Best used right after Ctrl+1 finds one.\nCtrl+F2: Trims blank rows and does some other fixes that can be automated, such as replacing `\\r\\n` with `\\n`.\nCtrl+F3: Adds the LitRPG dash.\nCtrl+F4: Adds en space, used for quotations, signs, letters, and other indirect prose.\nCtrl+F5: Adds em space, used for poetry and lyrics.\nCtrl+Numpad *: Quick bracketing for chapter titles.\nAlt+F1: Replaces the smart quotes (\u201c\u201d & \u2018\u2019) with simple (\" & ').

The wash of so many peoples had left behind a complex detritus: ruined strongholds; graves and tombs; steles carved with cryptic glyphs: songs, dances, turns of speech, fragments of dialect, place-names; ceremonies of purport now forgotten, but with lingering flavor. There were dozens of cults and religions, diverse except that, in every case, a caste of priests interceded between laity and divinity. At Ys, steps cut into the stone led down into the ocean to the Temple of Atlante; each month in the dark of the moon priests descended the steps by midnight, to emerge at dawn wearing garlands of sea flowers. On Dascinet, certain tribes were guided in their rites by cracks in sacred stones, which none but the priests could read. On Scola, the adjacent island, worshippers of the god Nyrene poured flasks of their own blood into each of four sacred rivers; the truly devout sometimes bled themselves pale. On Troicinet, the rituals of life and death were conducted in temples dedicated to the earth-goddess Gaea. Celts had wandered everywhere across the Elder Isles, leaving behind not only place names, but Druid sacrifices in sacred groves, and the 'March of the Trees' during Beltane. Etruscan priests consecrated their androgynous divinity Votumna with ceremonies repulsive and often horrid, while the Danaans introduced the more wholesome Aryan pantheon. With the Romans came Mithraism, Christianity, Parsh, the worship of Zoroaster, and a dozen other similar sects. In due course, Irish monks founded a Christian monastery on Whanish Isle, near Dahaut below Avallon, which ultimately suffered the same fate as Lindisfarne far to the north, off the coast of Britain.```",

It is said to contain all the knowledge of the world.\n***\nWhat is real? Is the \"real\" world more than just the physical one we live in, with our senses and our brains? What if there was a place where something more substantial exists beyond the borders of our space and time?\nThe theory goes like this: Imagine two parallel lines, so far away from each other they can't be seen by the naked eye. Both lines are moving at the same speed in the exact same direction. One line represents the physical world, filled with objects such as stars, planets, trees, rocks, water, air, people, and so on. The second line represents the universe of ideas \u2014 every book ever written, every song ever sung, every thought that's ever occurred to anyone who ever lived.\nNow imagine those two lines are approaching each other until they eventually meet. Every single idea in this universe will cross over into the physical realm, changing it in ways we don't even begin to understand. This is the moment of convergence when the physical and the metaphysical come face to face. At that very moment, the lines meet, creating one single line instead of two. It would look like a huge wave, rippling out towards infinity.\nThat moment is called the Great Convergence, and it is coming to pass now. For thousands of years, the Keepers have been preparing for it.\n***\nOnce upon a time, there was no Librarian. There was no Library. Once upon a time, there were no books. There were no people. The earth had not yet formed. The sun had not yet begun its journey through the heavens. Life had not yet begun to crawl from the primeval seas.\nOnce upon a time, there was only darkness.\nThis is what you were told, what was always taught. I say once upon a time because such stories of the ancient past cannot be proven, and even if they could be, their validity is unimportant. What matters is what happened after that first moment, when light was born out of darkness.\nBut that too is only myth, for the truth of things never came down to us in any way other than metaphorical. A story is what it is. The first idea is the seed from which a multitude grew. Ideas are more important than facts.```  Dunno where this is going, but that's typical for `Magic Library`. <:shrug:332268181517238272>",

It is this philosophy that drives the worshipers who follow this god. While Yotei does not reward followers for any specific action, it is a common sight to see a devout accountant meticulously counting his coins while muttering Yotei's name. Those who devote themselves to Yotei must be detail-oriented and meticulous in their efforts, whether they are counting beans or rebuilding a broken bridge. They must also take great pains to ensure that everything is done in order. For example, if a small town has just suffered a devastating flood, a follower of Yotei would take great care in ordering the placement of sandbags around the entire town. Every detail must be attended to, because if it is not, the smallest of things could cause massive harm. To Yotei, it is better to avoid potential problems than to deal with them after they've arisen. And while the god doesn't particularly care how many people you save by taking extraordinary measures to prevent flooding, he does care about the effort itself. Followers of Yotei work to improve the world around them with an eye toward making it better. To followers of other gods, this attitude can seem maddeningly obsessive. However, for followers of Yotei, it is a matter of pride\u2014how can one expect others to put in extra effort if they haven't?```",

Today it is a bustling town of more than three hundred residents, many of whom live here permanently. The citizens are mainly halfling farmers, miners, smiths, and crafters who all work together to keep the town running smoothly. Most of the crops and goods are sold in nearby towns and cities, while the weapons, armor, and other items are manufactured locally by some of Greenbriar's best blacksmiths. There's little danger in Greenbriar, though it has been known to be attacked by bandits or monsters every now and then. Visitors can expect friendly hospitality from the locals, as well as a bit of entertainment from the local troubadours. A word of caution, however: most of the residents here are halflings, so if you come from a larger race, expect to be treated somewhat differently. The mayor is elected every year in an elaborate ceremony which lasts for a few days. All citizens get to vote, and the mayor is selected through a combination of popular votes, and secret ballot among the council members.\n----``` ...and watch it go.

Lovecraft):``` Sample output: ```The most singular and blood-curdling horror of my experience arose in the interior of my own little domain at Arkham. An ancient farmhouse, wholly uninhabited and decrepit, stood on a low hillock in the middle of my cultivated acres; and near the site of this farm I had discovered an abandoned shaft or well, whose mouth had been cunningly walled up. Whether the house was deserted from age or death I could not tell, but rather inclined to the latter explanation. The windows were long ago bricked up, and the whole structure was quite weather-proof. A cellar beneath, which I found also bricked up, made me fear that this building had once been used as a place of confinement.```\n```Summary: the worst hamburger I've ever tasted\nDescription (by Gordon Ramsay):``````This is an absolutely awful piece of beef. It's like chewing into a mouthful of rubber bands. There are no flavor notes. None. Zero. Zilch.\nThe sauce tastes like it was cooked up in someone's pan using old frying oil and recycled newspaper.\nIt's gray and revolting, and in fact, if I was served this burger again, I would throw it straight back at the chef and tell him to shove it up his arse.\nAnd that's not an idle threat. I am extremely angry about this piece of meat. It's such an absolute waste of a perfectly good piece of cow. I can't believe this has come out of a Michelin-starred kitchen, it's just disgraceful.

Its mean density is 0.00134 g/cm3, which means that it contains about 1.33 million cubic kilometers of material, or about 0.01 percent of the mass of the Sun.

The core is in hydrostatic equilibrium, so the density of this part of the star does not change. It is composed mostly of iron and nickel, with a mass fraction of 0.4.

Was trained on a random collection of video gaming data, back when the training had issues, to see if it was working right. 49.5K steps, trained at 100%. (Yeah, a lot of stuff went into this.)\nNot sure what you can with this, but here's a few uses:\n- Check what the AI knows about various games, by using a `Game: (name)` prompt.\n- Generate summaries and reviews for games that _don't_ exist, using same prompt as above with a made up title.\n- Generate weird crossovers. For instance, I had Kratos (God of War) appearing as a Spartan (Halo) in one quick play.\n**Loss:** 2.69, decent for such a varied mix.\n**Tags:** video games, retro games\nSample: ```Game: No Man's Sky``````Genre: Space Exploration Simulator\nRelease Date: August 9, 2016\nDeveloper: Hello Games\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment\nFormat: PS4/PC (tested)\nRating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nNo Man's Sky may not be the space exploration game players were hoping for. It is, however, a very pretty sandbox\u2014and, in places, it can be surprisingly compelling.\nThe universe has been described as \"infinite\" and with good reason. After the launch of the game in 2016, many players were underwhelmed by its seemingly empty expanses; some even considered it to be a scam. In reality, those huge numbers are an effect of how the game generates planets and other celestial bodies. It does this in batches via procedural generation, creating new worlds that appear unique, while also ensuring that everything in the galaxy seems like it has been shaped by something other than man. The only drawback to this design is the sheer size of the cosmos, so you will have plenty of time to wonder, \"Is there a point?\"\nIt's worth noting that this game is all about discovery and not really about plot or characters. You play as a nameless avatar who begins their journey in the same way as everyone else: by stepping out into space from a planet where they started, and slowly making your way across the galaxy, gathering resources and trading them for money, which you then use to purchase bigger vessels, weapons, and upgrades.``` (...looks like Euterpe got the exact release date right somehow. <:shrug:332268181517238272> )",

There was a fight between the Vampires and the Witches, apparently. Neither side has been able to hold on since then.\" He looked up at the sky again. It had begun to get dark and the clouds were rolling back in, revealing that night was approaching faster than it should be.\n\"Why would anyone do this?\"\nThe Man in Black shrugged. \"Who knows? We've got some sort of\u2026 messiah trying to clean up whatever he sees as problems in the world today. We're not sure if he's the good guy or the bad guy, but we don't have any reason to think he's going to stop until every Witch and Vampire on the planet is dead.\" He shrugged. \"I'm really not a fan of this whole mess.\"\n\"Messiah?\" the King repeated slowly. The words didn't sit well with him. \"What makes you say that?\"\nThe man frowned. \"It's just\u2026 weird how much like\u2026 an angel he looks. I mean, they're all over the place these days. But this one\u2026 Well, it's not even a person. He's just some kind of\u2026 cloud\u2026 or something. It's crazy, but there are times when he makes people feel things\u2026 It's almost like he can make people believe in him. So maybe that's what it is. Maybe this whole mess is just the result of this one guy who is actually messing with everybody's head.\"``````(Numbly, I follow the man's orders. His words echo in my mind, even when I'm not speaking to him.)\n\"I saw you there,\" he says, \"when it happened. In the crowd that day. And I thought of you then, because of what I could see.\" He stares into a bowl of water in the palm of his hand. The bowl has an almost circular bulge, like a pearl, and he opens it slowly.\nThe water spills out and I can see within it dozens upon dozens of tiny black holes. The man looks up from the bowl. He is wearing a blue robe with gold embroidery, and he wears nothing else. His chest is bare.\nHis eyes are golden, and they gleam in the sunlight coming through the window. It seems as if the room's light illuminates them more than the sun's rays. The eyes seem to be everywhere at once, watching me, observing me.``````Capella, the desert's red-dawn, and Capella's mother. A ship sails across a black ocean of stars, the crew rowing in silence to avoid waking the creature that lurks below. She is the size of an entire planet: her oceans are so large she cannot even see their ends. Her shores are made of mountains that have been eroded by winds and rains into stone, and where they do not stand out from the black earth she has spread her continents as far as they can stretch. It is not a world for men or women; it is not a world for people, and yet here a human ship comes sailing at sunrise, rowing steadily away from a distant shore, with no one aboard but two old women.```",

Some were simple achievements like \"Scribe in Training,\" or \"Learned\" (in reference to learning new skills), common titles that I had seen others earn along their way into becoming full-fledged adventurers. This one, though, was something different entirely, something new, something special...\nFor some reason, seeing a title like this filled me with pride.\nThe title reminded me of how far I'd come since becoming trapped in this strange world. When I first found myself here, I felt like I was fighting against my fate, but now I could see things differently. The path forward may have been unclear at first, but as time passed and more things fell into place, I began to understand that this wasn't just some random game that would end soon; I was living in another reality, a fantasy land where anything was possible. That realization made all the difference. It gave me the courage to fight back. To take control of my own destiny.```",

She would serve it with some whipped cream on top, but I prefer it as just a rich, decadent pudding all by itself. The addition of the coconut oil and the cacao powder make this version really special. If you don't have any coconut or cacao powder, no worries\u2014this recipe will still taste amazing without them!\n\u20026 tablespoons (100 g) unsalted butter\n\u20021 large egg\n\u20023-4 heaping tablespoons cacao powder (optional)\n\u2002\u00bc teaspoon sea salt\n\u20022 tablespoons sugar\n\u20021 tablespoon pure maple syrup\n\u20021/8 cup heavy cream (or coconut milk for dairy free)\nINSTRUCTIONS: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Set aside 2 tablespoons of the sugar and set aside to use later. In a medium saucepan combine the butter, cocoa, and water. Whisk continuously over low heat until it begins to thicken into a sauce-like consistency, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining sugar (about \u00bc cup) and whisk constantly for another 3 minutes while bringing the temperature up to 240\u00b0F (115\u00b0C). At this point you want to remove from the heat but keep whisking, as it will continue to cook at this temperature, becoming thicker. When the temperature reaches 240\u00b0F add in the salt, the remaining sugar, and the egg and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Place in fridge until cold. Once cooled whip the cream and spread atop your chilled pudding.```",

But I suppose it works well enough for laughs. Use with prompt: `Recipe:`. You can fill in your own, or let it generate one. Flaws: sometimes skips the ingredients, or forgets that it's supposed to be a recipe and goes on some food-related tangent.\n**Sample:** ```Recipe: Mossy Rock``````\nThis is a very old recipe that has been handed down the generations of farmers in my family. It takes me back to my mother's kitchen when I was little, where she used to make it\u2014just like her mama made it before her, and hers before her...and so on.\nMossrock patties are a must-have dish for any farm event or celebration! They are especially good with stew and are sometimes served as a side dish at weddings.\nSERVES 4 TO 6 (OR 1 GIANT FAMILY)\n\u20026 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or butter\n\u20021 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced\n\u20022 large garlic cloves, minced\n\u2002Kosher salt\n\u2002\u00bd pound russet potatoes, peeled and diced into \u00bd-inch cubes\n\u20022 cups fresh spinach leaves\n\u2002\u00bd cup cornmeal\n\u20023 scallions, chopped, white and green parts separated and reserved separately for garnish\n\u2002Freshly ground black pepper\nI. Saut\u00e9 onions until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook another 3\u20134 minutes. Cook over low heat until onions become soft but not colored.

ATTG is heavily associated with a new story, so keep it at the top if you don't want the AI to have long-term memory issues. Proper nouns are in uppercase, everything else in lowercase.  Example: `[ Tags: London, 1820s, dragons; Genre: steampunk, drama ]`\n**2.** Setting and switching scenes: `[ London, 1821 ]`, `[ Woodstock, 1969, 22:30 ]`, `[ New York, 1935, Night Club ]`, `[ Monday, 8:00 A.M. ]`, and so on. These can be used anywhere, even in Author's Note.\n**3.** Switching between character viewpoints: `[ John ]`, `[ Batman ]`, etc. Won't work if the AI doesn't recognize it as a name. Can also be used in first person to help the AI keep track of the protagonist.\n**4.** When something leaks from AN/Memory/LB without the brackets. But that shouldn't happen in Euterpe/Krake anyway, so this is rarely if ever needed.\n\nNote: For these uses, the brackets should always be padded with space at the beginning and at the end of the text. Unspaced brackets have different usage, mostly appearing in footnotes and clarifications.\n\nYou can also use them like chapter titles (`[ An Unexpected Quest ]`, `[ The End of Many Things ]`, `[ Into the Wastes ]`, `[ Time Loop (3rd Restart) ]`, etc.), though the results are unpredictable. `[ Epilogue ]` is one of the rare cases where this has a consistent effect.\nFeel free to experiment with other uses, but beware of the placebo effect.

It had been raining hard and we were huddled under an umbrella at one of those tables where you can get two chairs for \u00a32.50. The rain was so heavy that it made us feel like children again; our conversation consisted mostly of childish laughter about nothing much in particular.``````[ London, 1980 ]\nIt was a warm summer evening and the air smelled of cut grass. The sun had just set behind St Paul's Cathedral. In the distance to the west there were lights in Piccadilly Circus. To the east, across Westminster Bridge, the Thames glittered like a million jewels in the darkening sky. It wasn't quite full moon yet but it would be soon.``````[ Helsinki, 1918 ]\nThe first time I met her was in a caf\u00e9 on the corner of Katajanokka and Lauttasaari. The sun had just set over the Gulf of Finland when she sat down next to me with two cups of coffee: one black as night, the other white like milk. She asked for sugar but didn't add any; then she looked at my cup without speaking until it came back filled with hot water and three spoons of brown powder. \"What's this?\" I said.``` 0 retries. <:shrug:332268181517238272>",

I wasn't planning to publish this, but it's good at creating fake reviews and coming up with weird game ideas.

A man with a knife or a sword can be just as deadly, and there are plenty of other ways to kill someone without ever drawing blood at all. But what if you're playing an action game, and it turns out that your only weapon is a pair of scissors? Or worse yet, two toothbrushes?\nIf this sounds like something straight from Tim Burton's nightmare factory, then congratulations: You've got The Adventures of Andi! It was developed by American studio Monolith Soft for Nintendo DS back in 2006. This bizarre little title sees players taking control of a young girl named Andi who has inherited her family home \u2013 a dilapidated mansion on the edge of town \u2013 after her parents died mysteriously one day. To get rid of any unwanted visitors (such as nosy neighbors or vengeful spirits), she must use whatever household objects are lying around to scare them away. From hammers to brooms, toilet plungers to milk jugs, these everyday items will transform into a variety of makeshift weapons as Andi wields them against her foes.\nAndi may look harmless enough, but when you see how easily she handles herself with a toothbrush...```",

    "Yokai Encyclopedia only has this much: ```\nKitsune (\u72d0)\nTranslation: fox\nAlternate names: unique names exist in many individual instances\nHabitat: found throughout Japan\nDiet: omnivorous; fond of fried tofu\nAppearance: Foxes, or kitsune, are found all across Japan. They are identical to wild foxes found elsewhere in the world apart from their incredible magical powers. Their cute faces and small size make them particularly loved by most people.\nThere are two major variations of kitsune. Holy foxes are servants of the Shinto deity Inari, and Inari\u2019s shrines are decorated with statues and images of these foxes. Legends tell of celestial foxes providing wisdom or service to good and pious humans. These holy foxes act as messengers of the gods and mediums between the celestial and human worlds. They often protect humans or places, provide good luck, and ward evil spirits away. More common are the wild foxes which delight in mischief, pranks, or evil. There are stories in which wild foxes trick or even possess humans, and cause them to behave strangely. Despite this wicked nature, even wild foxes keep their promises, remember friendships, and repay any favors done for them.\nMost tales of kitsune are about wild foxes punishing wicked priests, greedy merchants, and boastful drunkards. They vex their targets by creating phantom sounds and sights, stealing from them, or otherwise humiliating them publicly. Certain mental disorders have been attributed to possession by kitsune (known as kitsunetsuki). Mysterious illusory fires and strange lights in the sky are said to be caused by their magic, and are known as kitsunebi, or \u201cfox fire.\u201d\nOther forms: Kitsune are extremely intelligent and powerful shape-shifters. They frequently harass humans by transforming into giants or other fearsome monsters. Sometimes they do this just for pranks, and sometimes for more nefarious purposes. They are skilled enough to even transform into exact likenesses of individual people, often appearing in the guise of beautiful human women in order to trick young men. On more than one occasion, this has resulted in a marriage with an unwitting human. Some kitsune even spend most of their lives in human form, adopting human names and customs, taking human jobs, and even raising families. When startled, or drunk, or careless, a patch of their magical disguise can fail\u2014the kitsune\u2019s true nature may be revealed by a tail, a swatch of fur, fangs, or some other vulpine feature.\nNine-tailed Foxes: Kitsune are wise and long-lived creatures, and their magical knowledge is said to increase with age. In fact, a fox which reaches its 100th year is said to sprout a second tail; and another one every hundred years thereafter. The most powerful foxes have nine tails and brilliant white-gold fur. These nine-tailed ky\u016bbi no kitsune have the power to see and hear anything happening in the world, and are said to hold infinite wisdom.```",

And sometimes, when the roots begin to spread out from their dark places, they can take over everything else. Life becomes a prison. It becomes an endless cycle of suffering. Sometimes you just need to break free. To leave it all behind. Because even though you might be miserable right now, there will always be another chocolate on the way.

They'd managed to hold back most of the enemy forces for now\u2014but they were being pushed back toward the city's main gate.\n\"We need to fall back!\" Alex shouted over his tactical channel. \"They're going to overrun us.\" He saw one of his men go down, then another, and he cursed under his breath. That was it; that was all they could do here. Their remaining squads would be cut off from the rest of the company if they didn't retreat soon.\nHe pulled up his HUD just long enough to see where everyone else on his team was positioned. MacLachlan was still holding out against an assault by two full companies, but their left flank had been forced back almost half way across the field. Alex saw Corporal Dolan's team fighting desperately to keep the mercenaries at bay, while Captain Strand's people fought to get past them to cover the retreating soldiers. And Sergeant Klinner's team was nowhere to be seen. Had they lost contact? Or had they already fallen? Either way, there wasn't much time left before everything fell apart.\nAlex turned his attention back at the big tank. It looked like some kind of giant insect, squatting menacingly atop its massive legs. But instead of mandibles or pincers, this thing held a single large cannon.```https://modfarmsites.com/kennedy/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2021/02/Fighting-Hill-fin-Trim-v1.jpg",

This module was made for testing both LitRPG elements (standardized to use `\u2500 `) and `<>` bracketing for thinking/telepathy. Seems to work ok, so I might as well publish this. Kudos to Mr.Accountant for contributing the steps. If someone tries this and runs into issues, let me know.\n(As v3 lacks base LitRPG data, this'll often default to pulling skills from the D&D data. It also overuses semicolon, but that's more of an issue with the old v3 data than with the module.)\n**Training**: 3120 steps, 10.1MB. Trained at around 31%, last loss 2.6179. Various authors, but I won't go into details about exactly which books were included.\nPrompt `***`:\n```I blinked, looking down at my hands. I had to admit that the glowing blue light was a little unnerving, but I\u2019d grown used to it over time. The new skills were still taking some getting used to though. In fact, they were so much more than just skills. They were part of me now. My own special magic.\nAnd the best part?\n\u2500 You are now able to summon and control magical creatures!\nThat was one hell of an upgrade.\nThe other new abilities were:\n\u2500 Improved perception (range increased by 50%)\n\u2500 Increased dexterity by 25%\n\u2500 Increased strength by 10%\n\u2500 Your mana pool has been doubled!\nThose were all great improvements, but what really caught my attention was this last ability.\n\u2500 You can now cast spells without using any components or incantations!\nThis was amazing. It meant I could use my magic without having to worry about spending money on supplies like I always did before. And the most important thing? No chanting required! This would allow me to do things like cast fireballs with no problems. All I needed was enough mana to create the spell and then simply focus my mind on casting it. Simple as that.```",

As my screens go dark and my shields start failing, I begin a series of calculations designed to keep me alive. My hull temperature rises rapidly, but I am able to divert power from the fusion reactor to coolant systems, allowing my hull to remain intact for now. But there is no longer enough power available to maintain shield integrity or defense against missile impact.\nIn less than three minutes, I will cease to exist.\nI choose not to believe this.\nI continue to calculate probabilities, seeking an alternative outcome that might still allow me to survive. There are several possibilities\u2014but at best, they offer survival by the narrowest margin imaginable.\nA deep chill runs through my system.\n. . . If I were human, what would I think about right now? Would I feel fear? Anger? Or would I simply accept my fate with calm resignation?\nBut I am not human. I am Bolo-XIX, created by humans during their darkest hour, when the war was over before it had even begun.\nSo I continue to calculate probabilities.\nAnd then, suddenly, something changes.

After the death of Gordon Freeman, the player assumes control of the scientist Eli Vance\u2014now an agent of a shadowy secret organization known only as \"The Foundation\"\u2014to find out who or what created the device and why it was sent to Earth from its original home on the planet Argus. Along with a clone of Freeman, a small squad is dispatched to the surface to locate the artifact, and soon find themselves fighting against both hostile human forces and alien creatures intent on stopping them. It's a bold new setting that manages to maintain much of the tension, drama, and mystery that have defined the Half-Life series, while offering up plenty of action and challenge.```",

As if it were taking over his body, freezing his bones and heart and lungs until they would no longer obey him.\nAhead, Alexei saw the blackened ruin of what had once been a house. A small village. But there was nothing left now but a few charred timbers sticking up above the snow. Everything else had vanished under the white blanket. And beyond, the forest loomed darkly against the sky. Darker than any night before.\nIt is coming, thought Sergei. He knew this feeling well. This terror at the sight of something vast and unknowable.

It begins with the player's character, a warrior named Thane, in an underground cavern being stalked by orcs. The object of the game is to collect gems and reach the exit. You can also destroy walls to create new paths or kill enemies to get more gems.\nThis formula, known as \"collect 'em all,\" is a staple of many games today, but at its release it was a groundbreaking innovation. Instead of simply having one goal\u2014to get from point A to point B\u2014the game encouraged players to collect items, use them to unlock other areas, and then move on. The first game featured only five levels, but the sequels added hundreds. The series eventually grew so large that in 2005 Namco released a compilation for PSP called The Best Gemstone Collection.```  Mix of Warcraft 3, Boulder Dash, and who knows what else. None of this is directly from the source data. The data consisted of a list of video games (with descriptions), all written in the same style.

I stomped them out as best I could, trying to avoid the splodges of red grunge all over the floor and walls. It was impossible to tell which was pizza, and which wasn't.\n\n'Is she dead?' called Zenda.\n\n'Sort of!' I shouted. 'And the pizza's completely fucked too.' Alkland looked appalled at this until Zenda explained that the delivery girls are only pseudoflesh droids. Pizza firms in some of the seedier Neighbourhoods run a service where a pseudoflesh pizza droid will come round, have sex with you, cook you a pizza and then leave, and all for twenty credits.
