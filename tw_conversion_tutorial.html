      i am "let's kill Moloch" on Discord, i hang out in the EleutherAI discord, send me a message
      
      who is this "Moloch" person? are you in a death cult? should I call the police?
      (don't worry Moloch is not a person. murder is bad. unless it's a metaphorical demon that represents a whole bunch of really bad things)

      go complain at a wall.
      
      be happy you have it for free. i spent probably between 100 and 200 hours on this. and it fucking works. it's a great app, despite being somewhat weird and buggy.

      because it was originally made for making interactive stories with Twine.
      and to work with .tw files, which is then compiled into a .html file using software called "tweego"

      add passage <title>
      
      delete passage <title>
      
      change color <title> color
      
      mass link
      
      mass color
      
      change tab <nameofmindmap>
      
      some extra things:
      - to make a change register, you have to click another passage in the list to the left. if you click the same one, it's usually okay, but sometimes weird things happen.
      	- if weird things happen just restart the app. has always worked for me. lol
      - mass color and mass link still require explanation, everything else also needs explanations probably
      - let's actually seriously--no but i mean like no cap--like actually save the world! :D
      
      oh and dont ever use quotations marks in the name lol. i think it makes the matrix glitch.
