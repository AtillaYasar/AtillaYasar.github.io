      "by Duncan Sabien" <-- in the opening to the book
      from the CFAR participant handbook, page 91 and page 144
      
      crux in short: "look for common ground instead of trying to figure out who is right"
      double crux in short: "find common ground between disagreeing sub-agents"
      
      person a: "lets explore space"
      person b: "nah bro"
      solution:
      	- assume this is a clash of *models*, rather than a clash of *outputs*
      	- use good faith principle
      	- the victory condition is not complete resolution of the argument, but rather, finding agreement on a *shared model of the world*
      	- steps:
      		- operationalize the disagreement ("i believe x because of y")
      		- find "double crux", aka common ground
      		- resonate, "id agree with you if x were true"
      
      The double crux perspective claims that the “space or not space” question
      isn’t particularly interesting, and that a better target for the conversation
      might be something like “what would we have to know about the universe to
      confidently answer the ’space or not space’ question?” In other words, rather
      than seeing the disagreement as a clash of outputs, double crux encourages
      us to see it as a clash of models.

      central idea:
      how much youre suffering is not necessarily a good indicator of how much effort youre putting in
      
      anecdotes:
      	- mom thought if hes happy hes not trying his best and not tired
      	- abusive sports coach
      	- overachievers
      
      antidotes:
      	- if it hurts, you're probably doing it wrong
      	- if youre not happy, youre not doing your best (because happiness is very useful)

      <p style="color:purple"> plans-are-recursive </p>
      https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xrrycug4DWSdqBhjQ/plans-are-recursive-and-why-this-is-important
      
      by "resursive" she means, plans are made of parts, which are also made of parts, etc.
      (she actually gets into why she uses this fancy word)
      
      her reasons for writing this:
      - Crucial principles of good planning are readily derived from a recursive model of planning. Having a solid grasp of the recursive models makes it harder to forget these key principles.
      - An explicit treatment of a topic can help it sink in deeper to intuition even if one already has some sense of it.
      - Even if everyone has an intuitive sense of something, it can be hard to talk about the thing if there isn’t a common explicit handle.
      
      "doubly recursive because you must choose the plan, but also the execution, which are both recursive"
      (i dont fully follow but its fine)
      
      implications of the recursive nature
      - (almost) all plans are sub-plans, and (almost) all goals are sub-goals.
      - "Goals/Steps/Actions/Plans are Isomorphic" (meaning, basically the same)
      - you should consider the higher goal of a goal, "what upper goal is this goal a step within?"
      
      other points:
      - long term planning has slow feedback
      - long term planning is influenced by short term factions such as emotions
      - success of low level goal can only be determined in terms of how it helps with a higher level goal. (so if the sub goal is bad, it is meaningless even if you crush it)
      
      personal note:
      this convinced me that maybe i shouldnt regard an article so dismissively when the ideas seem obvious or trivial or not mindblowing-and-earth-shattering. just putting things concretely and thinking about them can let them sink in more deeply.

      problem:
      	- we want to slow down when were uncertain
      	- we half-ass things if were uncertain
      
      solution:

      ok but why write a whole article? also this is kinda obvious.

      problem:
      "The planning fallacy is that people think they can plan, ha ha."
      
      solution:
      in short:
      look at similar projects, dont think about the details
      in long:
      "So there is a fairly reliable way to fix the planning fallacy, if you’re doing something broadly similar to a reference class of previous projects. Just ask how long similar projects have taken in the past, without considering any of the special properties of this project. Better yet, ask an experienced outsider how long similar projects have taken."

      Cheatsheet: 10 Questions to Ask Before Delegating or Buying
      Are there aspects that I don't care about but providers take great pains to provide?
      Do I believe that my preferred set of tradeoffs differs substantially from the median?
      Do I have reason to believe I'll be savvier than the average consumer of this product or service?
      In particular, is there catastrophic risk associated with this offering, and do I have reason to believe I am much less susceptible than average?
      Do providers have access to some kind of specialized capital or technology for which I lack good substitutes?
      Do providers have substantial overhead that I would not? This includes regulatory burden and security.
      How much of the cost is spent on signaling quality?
      Do I hope to have a lot of repeat business with the same provider?
      How much of the price is spent on transaction costs?
      How do I know whether and when the special expertise claimed by the provider is beneficial?
      How much do I value the learning from doing it myself?
      Do I expect to use the knowledge gained?
      Is the learning involved overly specialized?
      Are there other ways in which the thing to be bought is substantially different from what I'd do for myself?
