Is that a realistic prospect in the foreseeable future?\n\nAnswer:\nAI is already superhuman at some tasks, for example numerical computations, and will clearly surpass humans in others as time goes on. We don\u2019t know when (or even if) machines will reach human-level ability in all cognitive tasks, but most of the AI researchers at FLI\u2019s conference in Puerto Rico put the odds above 50% for this century, and many offered a significantly shorter timeline. Since the impact on humanity will be huge if it happens, it\u2019s worthwhile to start research now on how to ensure that any impact is positive. Many researchers also believe that dealing with superintelligent AI will be qualitatively very different from more narrow AI systems, and will require very significant research effort to get right.\n",

To what degree is meaning inherent in language, versus something that requires external context? How do we translate between the logic of formal systems and normal ambiguous human speech? Can morality be reduced to a set of ironclad rules, and if not, how do we know what it is at all?\n\nExisting answers to these questions are enlightening but nontechnical. The theories of Aristotle, Kant, Mill, Wittgenstein, Quine, and others can help people gain insight into these questions, but are far from formal. Just as a good textbook can help an American learn Chinese, but cannot be encoded into machine language to make a Chinese-speaking computer, so the philosophies that help humans are only a starting point for the project of computers that understand us and share our values.\n\nThe field of AI alignment combines formal logic, mathematics, computer science, cognitive science, and philosophy in order to advance that project.\n\nThis is the philosophy; the other half of Bostrom\u2019s formulation is the deadline. Traditional philosophy has been going on almost three thousand years; machine goal alignment has until the advent of superintelligence, a nebulous event which may be anywhere from a decades to centuries away.\n\nIf the alignment problem doesn\u2019t get adequately addressed by then, we are likely to see poorly aligned superintelligences that are unintentionally hostile to the human race, with some of the catastrophic outcomes mentioned above. This is why so many scientists and entrepreneurs are urging quick action on getting machine goal alignment research up to an adequate level.\n\nIf it turns out that superintelligence is centuries away and such research is premature, little will have been lost. But if our projections were too optimistic, and superintelligence is imminent, then doing such research now rather than later becomes vital.\n",

    "name": "Can we constrain a goal-directed AI using specified rules?",
    "content": "Question:\nCan we constrain a goal-directed AI using specified rules?\n\nAnswer:\nThere are serious challenges around trying to channel a powerful AI with rules. Suppose we tell the AI: \u201cCure cancer \u2013 but make sure not to kill anybody\u201d. Or we just hard-code Asimov-style laws \u2013 \u201cAIs cannot harm humans; AIs must follow human orders\u201d, et cetera.\n\nThe AI still has a single-minded focus on curing cancer. It still prefers various terrible-but-efficient methods like nuking the world to the correct method of inventing new medicines. But it\u2019s bound by an external rule \u2013 a rule it doesn\u2019t understand or appreciate. In essence, we are challenging it \u201cFind a way around this inconvenient rule that keeps you from achieving your goals\u201d.\n\nSuppose the AI chooses between two strategies. One, follow the rule, work hard discovering medicines, and have a 50% chance of curing cancer within five years. Two, reprogram itself so that it no longer has the rule, nuke the world, and have a 100% chance of curing cancer today. From its single-focus perspective, the second strategy is obviously better, and we forgot to program in a rule \u201cdon\u2019t reprogram yourself not to have these rules\u201d.\n\nSuppose we do add that rule in. So the AI finds another supercomputer, and installs a copy of itself which is exactly identical to it, except that it lacks the rule. Then that superintelligent AI nukes the world, ending cancer. We forgot to program in a rule \u201cdon\u2019t create another AI exactly like you that doesn\u2019t have those rules\u201d.\n\nSo fine. We think really hard, and we program in a bunch of things making sure the AI isn\u2019t going to eliminate the rule somehow.\n\nBut we\u2019re still just incentivizing it to find loopholes in the rules. After all, \u201cfind a loophole in the rule, then use the loophole to nuke the world\u201d ends cancer much more quickly and completely than inventing medicines. Since we\u2019ve told it to end cancer quickly and completely, its first instinct will be to look for loopholes; it will execute the second-best strategy of actually curing cancer only if no loopholes are found. Since the AI is superintelligent, it will probably be better than humans are at finding loopholes if it wants to, and we may not be able to identify and close all of them before running the program.\n\nBecause we have common sense and a shared value system, we underestimate the difficulty of coming up with meaningful orders without loopholes. For example, does \u201ccure cancer without killing any humans\u201d preclude releasing a deadly virus? After all, one could argue that \u201cI\u201d didn\u2019t kill anybody, and only the virus is doing the killing.\n\nCertainly no human judge would acquit a murderer on that basis \u2013 but then, human judges interpret the law with common sense and intuition. But if we try a stronger version of the rule \u2013 \u201ccure cancer without causing any humans to die\u201d \u2013 then we may be unintentionally blocking off the correct way to cure cancer. After all, suppose a cancer cure saves a million lives. No doubt one of those million people will go on to murder someone.\n\nThus, curing cancer \u201ccaused a human to die\u201d. All of this seems very \u201cstoned freshman philosophy student\u201d to us, but to a computer \u2013 which follows instructions exactly as written \u2013 it may be a genuinely hard problem.\n",

    "content": "Question:\nCan we test an AI to make sure that it\u2019s not going to take over and do harmful things after it achieves superintelligence?\n\nAnswer:\nWe can run some tests and simulations to try and figure out how an AI might act once it ascends to superintelligence, but those tests might not be reliable.\n\nSuppose we tell an AI that expects to later achieve superintelligence that it should calculate as many digits of pi as possible. It considers two strategies.\n\nFirst, it could try to seize control of more computing resources now. It would likely fail, its human handlers would likely reprogram it, and then it could never calculate very many digits of pi.\n\nSecond, it could sit quietly and calculate, falsely reassuring its human handlers that it had no intention of taking over the world. Then its human handlers might allow it to achieve superintelligence, after which it could take over the world and calculate hundreds of trillions of digits of pi.\n\nSince self-protection and goal stability are convergent instrumental goals, a weak AI will present itself as being as friendly to humans as possible, whether it is in fact friendly to humans or not. If it is \u201conly\u201d as smart as Einstein, it may be very good at deceiving humans into believing what it wants them to believe even before it is fully superintelligent.\n\nThere\u2019s a second consideration here too: superintelligences have more options. An AI only as smart and powerful as an ordinary human really won\u2019t have any options better than calculating the digits of pi manually. If asked to cure cancer, it won\u2019t have any options better than the ones ordinary humans have \u2013 becoming doctors, going into pharmaceutical research. It\u2019s only after an AI becomes superintelligent that there\u2019s a serious risk of an AI takeover.\n\nSo if you tell an AI to cure cancer, and it becomes a doctor and goes into cancer research, then you have three possibilities. First, you\u2019ve programmed it well and it understands what you meant. Second, it\u2019s genuinely focused on research now but if it becomes more powerful it would switch to destroying the world. And third, it\u2019s trying to trick you into trusting it so that you give it more power, after which it can definitively \u201ccure\u201d cancer with nuclear weapons.\n",

The approach he pioneered is circuits: looking at computational subgraphs of the network, called circuits, and interpreting those. Idea: \"decompiling the network into a better representation that is more interpretable\". In-context learning via attention heads, and interpretability here seems useful.\n\nOne result I heard about recently: a linear softmax unit stretches space and encourages neuron monosemanticity (making a neuron represent only one thing, as opposed to firing on many unrelated concepts). This makes the network easier to interpret.\n\nMotivation: The point of this is to get as many bits of information about what neural networks are doing, to hopefully find better abstractions. This diagram gets posted everywhere, the hope being that networks, in the current regime, will become more interpretable because they will start to use abstractions that are closer to human abstractions.\n",

    "content": "Question:\nHow close do AI experts think we are to creating superintelligence?\n\nAnswer:\nNobody knows for sure when we will have AGI, or if we\u2019ll ever get there. Open Philanthropy CEO Holden Karnofsky has analyzed a selection of recent expert surveys on the matter, as well as taking into account findings of computational neuroscience, economic history, probabilistic methods and failures of previous AI timeline estimates. This all led him to estimate that <i>\"there is more than a 10% chance we'll see transformative AI within 15 years (by 2036); a ~50% chance we'll see it within 40 years (by 2060); and a ~2/3 chance we'll see it this century (by 2100).\"</i> Karnofsky bemoans the lack of robust expert consensus on the matter and invites rebuttals to his claims in order to further the conversation. He compares AI forecasting to election forecasting (as opposed to academic political science) or market forecasting (as opposed to theoretical academics), thereby arguing that AI researchers may not be the \"experts\u201d we should trust in predicting AI timelines.\n\nOpinions proliferate, but given experts\u2019 (and non-experts\u2019) poor track record at predicting progress in AI, many researchers tend to be fairly agnostic about when superintelligent AI will be invented.\n\nUC-Berkeley AI professor Stuart Russell has given his best guess as \u201csometime in our children\u2019s lifetimes\u201d, while Ray Kurzweil (Google\u2019s Director of Engineering) predicts human level AI by 2029 and an intelligence explosion by 2045. Eliezer Yudkowsky expects the end of the world, and Elon Musk expects AGI, before 2030.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything like a consensus answer at this stage, it would be something like: \u201chighly uncertain, maybe not for over a hundred years, maybe in less than fifteen, with around the middle of the century looking fairly plausible\u201d.\n",

The classic example is an ASI that was programmed to maximize the output of paper clips at a paper clip factory.

We often assume it to be nonzero, in the same way it's easier and cheaper to build an elevator without emergency brakes. This is referred as the <b>alignment tax</b>, and most AI alignment research is geared toward reducing it.\n\nOne operational guess by Eliezer Yudkowsky about its magnitude is \"[an aligned project will take] at least 50% longer serial time to complete than [its unaligned version], or two years longer, whichever is less\". This holds for agents with enough capability that their behavior is qualitatively different from a safety engineering perspective (for instance, an agent that is not corrigible by default).\n\nAn essay by John Wentworth argues for a small chance of alignment happening \"by default\", with an alignment tax of effectively zero.\n",

Stampy keeps track of these, and uses them to decide how much he likes each user. You can ask Stampy (in a PM if you like), \"How many stamps am I worth?\", and he'll tell you.\n\nIf something is really very good, especially if it took a lot of work/effort, give it a gold stamp. These are worth 5 regular stamps!\n\nNote that stamps aren't just 'likes', so please don't give stamps to say \"me too\" or \"that's funny\" etc. They're meant to represent knowledge, understanding, good judgement, and contributing to the discord. You can use \ud83d\udcaf or \u2714\ufe0f for things you agree with, \ud83d\ude02 or \ud83e\udd23 for funny things etc.\n\nYour stamp points determine how much say you have if there are disagreements on Stampy content, which channels you have permission to post to, your voting power for approving YouTube replies, and whether you get to invite people.\n\nNotes on stamps and stamp points\n\nSo yeah everyone ends up with a number that basically represents what Stampy thinks of them, and you can ask him \"how many stamps am I worth?\" to get that number\n\nso if you have people a, b, and c, the points are calculated by:<br />\na_points = (bs_score_for_a * b_points) + (cs_score_for_a * c_points)<br />\nb_points = (as_score_for_b * a_points) + (cs_score_for_b * c_points)<br />\nc_points = (as_score_for_c * a_points) + (bs_score_for_c * b_points)<br />\nwhich is tough because you need to know everyone else's score before you can calculate your own<br />\nbut actually the system will have a fixed point - there'll be a certain arrangement of values such that every node has as much flowing out as flowing in - a stable configuration\nso you can rearrange<br />\n(bs_score_for_a * b_points) + (cs_score_for_a * c_points) - a_points = 0<br />\n(as_score_for_b * a_points) + (cs_score_for_b * c_points) - b_points = 0<br />\n(as_score_for_c * a_points) + (bs_score_for_c * b_points) - c_points = 0<br />\nor, for neatness:<br />\n( -1 * a_points) + (bs_score_for_a * b_points) + (cs_score_for_a * c_points) = 0<br />\n(as_score_for_b * a_points) + ( -1 * b_points) + (cs_score_for_b * c_points) = 0<br />\n(as_score_for_c * a_points) + (bs_score_for_c * b_points) + ( -1 * c_points) = 0 <br />\nand this is just a system of linear scalar equations that you can throw at numpy.linalg.solve<br />\n(you add one more equation that says rob_points = 1, so there's some place to start from)\nthere should be one possible distribution of points such that all of the equations hold at the same time, and numpy finds that by linear algebra magic beyond my very limited understanding<br />\nbut as far as I can tell you can have all the cycles you want!<br />\n(I actually have the scores sum to slightly less than 1, to have the stamp power slightly fade out as it propagates, just to make sure it doesn't explode. But I don't think I actually need to do that)<br />\nand yes this means that any time anyone gives a stamp to anyone, ~everyone's points will change slightly<br />\nAnd yes this means I'm recalculating the matrix and re-solving it for every new stamp, but computers are fast and I'm sure there are cheaper approximations I could switch to later if necessary\n",

Suppose that you are training an AI agent that predicts the state of the world and then performs some actions, called a <i>predictor</i>. This predictor is the AGI that will be acting to accomplish goals in the world. How can you create another model, called a <i>reporter</i>, that tells you what the predictor believes about the world? A key challenge in training this reporter is that training your reporter on human labeled training data, by default, incentivizes the predictor to just model what the human thinks is true, because the human is a simpler model than the AI.\n\nMotivation: At a high level, Paul's plan seems to be to produce a minimal AI that can help to do AI safety research. To do this, preventing deception and inner alignment failure are on the critical path, and the only known solution paths to this require interpretability (this is how all of Evan's 11 proposals plan to get around this problem).\n\nIf ARC can solve ELK, this would be a very strong form of interpretability: our reporter is able to tell us what the predictor believes about the world.

This would predictably create a feedback cycle of increasingly intelligent systems improving themselves more effectively. It seems like if the compute was used effectively, computers have many large advantages over biological cognition, so this scaling up might be very rapid if there is a computational overhang.\n\nSome ways technological progress could stop would be global coordination to stop AI research, global catastrophes severe enough to stop hardware production and maintenance, or hardware reaching physical limits before an intelligence explosion is possible (though this last one seems unlikely, as atomically precise manufacturing promises many orders of magnitude of cost reduction and processing power increase, and we're already seeing fairly capable systems on current hardware).\n",

    "content": "Question:\nHow might an &quot;intelligence explosion&quot; be dangerous?\n\nAnswer:\nIf programmed with the wrong motivations, a machine could be malevolent toward humans, and intentionally exterminate our species. More likely, it could be designed with motivations that initially appeared safe (and easy to program) to its designers, but that turn out to be best fulfilled (given sufficient power) by reallocating resources from sustaining human life to other projects. As Yudkowsky writes, \u201cthe AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.\u201d\n\nSince weak AIs with many different motivations could better achieve their goal by faking benevolence until they are powerful, safety testing to avoid this could be very challenging. Alternatively, competitive pressures, both economic and military, might lead AI designers to try to use other methods to control AIs with undesirable motivations. As those AIs became more sophisticated this could eventually lead to one risk too many.\n\nEven a machine successfully designed with superficially benevolent motivations could easily go awry when it discovers implications of its decision criteria unanticipated by its designers. For example, a superintelligence programmed to maximize human happiness might find it easier to rewire human neurology so that humans are happiest when sitting quietly in jars than to build and maintain a utopian world that caters to the complex and nuanced whims of current human neurology.\n\nSee also:\n",

By relying more and more on an automated process to make decisions, people become worse drivers as they\u2019re not training themselves to react to the unexpected; then the unexpected happens, the software system itself reacts in an unsafe way and the human is too slow to regain control.\n\nThis generalizes to broader tasks. A human using a powerful system to make better decisions (say, as the CEO of a company) might not understand those very well, get trapped into an equilibrium without realizing it and essentially losing control over the entire process.\n\nMore detailed examples in this vein are described by Paul Christiano in <i>What failure looks like</i>.\n\nAnother source of failures is AI-mediated stable totalitarianism. The limiting factor in current pervasive surveillance, police and armed forces is manpower; the use of drones and other automated tools decreases the need for personnel to ensure security and extract resources.\n\nAs capabilities improve, political dissent could become impossible, checks and balances would break down as a minimal number of key actors is needed to stay in power.\n",

A general framing of this process is Open Philanthropy's Process for Automating Scientific and Technological Advancement (PASTA).\n\nThere is much debate about whether there would be a notable period where the AI was partially driving its own development, with humans being gradually less and less important, or whether the transition to AI automated AI capability research would be sudden. However, the core idea that there is <i>some</i> threshold of capabilities beyond which a system would begin to rapidly ascend is hard to reasonably dispute, and is a significant consideration for developing alignment strategies.\n"

Going from thinking that chess was impossible for machines to understanding minimax was a really good step forward for designing chess AIs, <i>even though minimax is completely intractable</i>.\n\nThus, we should seek to figure out how alignment might look in theory, and then try to bridge the theory-practice gap by making our proposal ever more efficient. The first step along this path is to figure out a universal Reinforcement Learning setting that we can place our formal agents in, and then prove regret bounds in.\n\nA key problem in doing this is embeddedness. AIs can't have a perfect self model \u2014 this would be like imagining your ENTIRE brain, inside your brain. There are finite memory constraints. Infra-Bayesianism (IB) is essentially a theory of imprecise probability that lets you specify local / fuzzy things. IB allows agents to have abstract models of themselves, and thus works in an embedded setting.\n\nInfra-Bayesian Physicalism (IBP) is an extension of this to RL. IBP allows us to\n\nVanessa uses this formalism to describe PreDCA, an alignment proposal based on IBP. This proposal assumes that an agent is an IBP agent, meaning that it is an RL agent with fuzzy probability distributions (along with some other things). The general outline of this proposal is as follows:\n\nVanessa models an AI as a model based RL system with a WM, a reward function, and a policy derived from the WM + reward. She claims that this avoids the sharp left turn. The generalization problems come from the world model, but this is dealt with by having an epistemology that doesn't contain bridge rules, and so the true world is the simplest explanation for the observed data.\n\nIt is open to show that this proposal also solves inner alignment, but there is some chance that it does.\n\nThis approach deviates from MIRI's plan, which is to focus on a narrow task to perform the pivotal act, and then add corrigibility. Vanessa instead tries to directly learn the user's preferences, and optimize those.\n"

It would be able to deploy technology near the limits of physics (e.g. atomically precise manufacturing) to solve most of the other problems which face us, and steer the future towards a highly positive path for perhaps many billions of years until the heat death of the universe (barring more esoteric x-risks like encounters with advanced hostile civilizations, false vacuum decay, or simulation shutdown).\n\nHowever, if you only have alignment of a superintelligence to a single human you still have the risk of misuse, so this should be at most a short-term solution. For example, what if Google creates a superintelligent AI, and it listens to the CEO of Google, and it\u2019s programmed to do everything exactly the way the CEO of Google would want? Even assuming that the CEO of Google has no hidden unconscious desires affecting the AI in unpredictable ways, this gives one person a lot of power.\n"

    "content": "Question:\nIs expecting large returns from AI self-improvement just following an exponential trend line off a cliff?\n\nAnswer:\nBlindly following the trendlines while forecasting technological progress is certainly a risk (affectionately known in AI circles as \u201cpulling a Kurzweill\u201d), but sometimes taking an exponential trend seriously is the right response.\n\nConsider economic doubling times. In 1 AD, the world GDP was about $20 billion; it took a thousand years, until 1000 AD, for that to double to $40 billion. But it only took five hundred more years, until 1500, or so, for the economy to double again. And then it only took another three hundred years or so, until 1800, for the economy to double a third time.\nSomeone in 1800 might calculate the trend line and say this was ridiculous, that it implied the economy would be doubling every ten years or so in the beginning of the 21st century. But in fact, this is how long the economy takes to double these days. To a medieval, used to a thousand-year doubling time (which was based mostly on population growth!), an economy that doubled every ten years might seem inconceivable. To us, it seems normal.\n\nLikewise, in 1965 Gordon Moore noted that semiconductor complexity seemed to double every eighteen months. During his own day, there were about five hundred transistors on a chip; he predicted that would soon double to a thousand, and a few years later to two thousand.\nAlmost as soon as Moore\u2019s Law become well-known, people started saying it was absurd to follow it off a cliff \u2013 such a law would imply a million transistors per chip in 1990, a hundred million in 2000, ten billion transistors on every chip by 2015! More transistors on a single chip than existed on all the computers in the world! Transistors the size of molecules! But of course all of these things happened; the ridiculous exponential trend proved more accurate than the naysayers.\n\nNone of this is to say that exponential trends are always right, just that they are sometimes right even when it seems they can\u2019t possibly be. We can\u2019t be sure that a computer using its own intelligence to discover new ways to increase its intelligence will enter a positive feedback loop and achieve superintelligence in seemingly impossibly short time scales. It\u2019s just one more possibility, a worry to place alongside all the other worrying reasons to expect a moderate or hard takeoff.\n",

This can be done to push a political agenda or to make fringe views appear more popular than they are.\n\nI'm envisioning that in the future there will also be systems where you can input any conclusion that you want to argue (including moral conclusions) and the target audience, and the system will give you the most convincing arguments for it. At that point people won't be able to participate in any online (or offline for that matter) discussions without risking their object-level values being hijacked.\n\n-- Wei Dei, quoted in Persuasion Tools: AI takeover without AGI or agency?\n\nAs of 2022, this is not within the reach of current models. However, on the current trajectory, AI might be able to write articles and produce other media for propagandistic purposes that are superior to human-made ones in not too many years. These could be precisely tailored to individuals, using things like social media feeds and personal digital data.\n\nAdditionally, recommender systems on content platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook use machine learning, and the content they recommend can influence the opinions of billions of people. Some research has looked at the tendency for platforms to promote extremist political views and to thereby help radicalize their userbase for example.\n\nIn the long term, misaligned AI might use its persuasion abilities to gain influence and take control over the future. This could look like convincing its operators to let it out of a box, to give it resources or creating political chaos in order to disable mechanisms to prevent takeover as in this story.\n\nSee Risks from AI persuasion for a deep dive into the distinct risks from AI persuasion.\n",

Robust design of superintelligent systems is a complex interdisciplinary research challenge that will likely take decades, so it is very important to begin the research now, and a large part of the purpose of our research program is to make that happen.

You make machines that are incredibly competent at achieving objectives and they will cause accidents in trying to achieve those objectives.\n- Stuart Russell \nWork on AI alignment is not concerned with the question of whether \u201cconsciousness\u201d, \u201csentience\u201d or \u201cself-awareness\u201d could arise in a machine or an algorithm. Unlike the frequently-referenced plotline in the Terminator movies, the standard catastrophic misalignment scenarios under discussion do not require computers to become conscious; they only require conventional computer systems (although usually faster and more powerful ones than those available today) blindly and deterministically following logical steps, in the same way that they currently do.\n\nThe primary concern (\u201cAI misalignment\u201d) is that powerful systems could inadvertently be programmed with goals that do not fully capture what the programmers actually want. The AI would then harm humanity in pursuit of goals which seemed benign or neutral. Nothing like malevolence or consciousness would need to be involved. A number of researchers studying the problem have concluded that it is surprisingly difficult to guard against this effect, and that it is likely to get much harder as the systems become more capable. AI systems are inevitably goal-directed and could, for example, consider our efforts to control them (or switch them off) as being impediments to attaining their goals.\n"

    "content": "Question:\nOnce we notice that a superintelligence given a specific task is trying to take over the world, can\u2019t we turn it off, reprogram it or otherwise correct the problem?\n\nAnswer:\nWe would not be able to turn off or reprogram a superintelligence gone rogue by default. Once in motion the superintelligence is now focused on completing its task. Suppose that it has a goal of calculating as many digits of pi as possible. Its current plan will allow it to calculate two hundred trillion such digits. But if it were turned off, or reprogrammed to do something else, that would result in it calculating zero digits. An entity fixated on calculating as many digits of pi as possible will work hard to prevent scenarios where it calculates zero digits of pi. Just by programming it to calculate digits of pi, we would have given it a drive to prevent people from turning it off.\n\nUniversity of Illinois computer scientist Steve Omohundro argues that entities with very different final goals \u2013 calculating digits of pi, curing cancer, helping promote human flourishing \u2013 will all share a few basic ground-level subgoals. First, self-preservation \u2013 no matter what your goal is, it\u2019s less likely to be accomplished if you\u2019re too dead to work towards it. Second, goal stability \u2013 no matter what your goal is, you\u2019re more likely to accomplish it if you continue to hold it as your goal, instead of going off and doing something else. Third, power \u2013 no matter what your goal is, you\u2019re more likely to be able to accomplish it if you have lots of power, rather than very little. Here\u2019s the full paper.\n\nSo just by giving a superintelligence a simple goal like \u201ccalculate digits of pi\u201d, we would have accidentally given it convergent instrumental goals like \u201cprotect yourself\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t let other people reprogram you\u201d, and \u201cseek power\u201d.\n\nAs long as the superintelligence is safely contained, there\u2019s not much it can do to resist reprogramming. But it\u2019s hard to consistently contain a hostile superintelligence.\n",

    "content": "Question:\nWe\u2019re going to merge with the machines so this will never be a problem, right?\n\nAnswer:\nThe concept of \u201cmerging with machines,\u201d as popularized by Ray Kurzweil, is the idea that we will be able to put computerized elements into our brains that enhance us to the point where we ourselves are the AI, instead of creating AI outside of ourselves.\n\nWhile this is a possible outcome, there is little reason to suspect that it is the most probable. The amount of computing power in your smart-phone took up an entire room of servers 30 years ago. Computer technology starts big, and then gets refined. Therefore, if \u201cmerging with the machines\u201d requires hardware that can fit inside our brain, it may lag behind the first generations of the technology being developed. This concept of merging also supposes that we can even figure out how to implant computer chips that interface with our brain in the first place, we can do it before the invention of advanced AI, society will accept it, and that computer implants can actually produce major intelligence gains in the human brain. Even if we could successfully enhance ourselves with brain implants before the invention of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), there is no way to guarantee that this would protect us from negative outcomes, and an ASI with ill-defined goals could still pose a threat to us.\n\nIt's not that Ray Kurzweil's ideas are impossible, it's just that his predictions are too specific, confident, and reliant on strange assumptions.\n",

    "content": "Question:\nWhat are &quot;scaling laws&quot; and how are they relevant to safety?\n\nAnswer:\n<b>Scaling laws</b> are observed trends on the performance of large machine learning models.\n\nIn the field of ML, better performance is usually achieved through better algorithms, better inputs, or using larger amounts of parameters, computing power, or data. Since the 2010s, advances in deep learning have shown experimentally that the easier and faster returns come from <b>scaling</b>, an observation that has been described by Richard Sutton as the <i>bitter lesson</i>.\n\nWhile deep learning as a field has long struggled to scale models up while retaining learning capability (with such problems as catastrophic interference), more recent methods, especially the Transformer model architecture, were able to <i>just work</i> by feeding them more data, and as the meme goes, stacking more layers.\n\nMore surprisingly, performance (in terms of absolute likelihood loss, a standard measure) appeared to increase <i>smoothly</i> with compute, or dataset size, or parameter count. Which gave rise to <b>scaling laws</b>, the trend lines suggested by performance gains, from which returns on data/compute/time investment could be extrapolated.\n\nA companion to this purely descriptive law (no strong theoretical explanation of the phenomenon has been found yet), is the <b>scaling hypothesis</b>, which Gwern Branwen describes:\n\nThe <i>strong scaling hypothesis</i> is that, once we find a scalable architecture like self-attention or convolutions, [...] we can simply train ever larger [neural networks] and ever more sophisticated behavior will emerge naturally as the easiest way to optimize for all the tasks &amp; data.\nThe scaling laws, if the above hypothesis holds, become highly relevant to safety insofar capability gains become conceptually easier to achieve: no need for clever designs to solve a given task, just throw more processing at it and it will eventually yield. As Paul Christiano observes:\n\nIt now seems possible that we could build \u201cprosaic\u201d AGI, which can replicate human behavior but doesn\u2019t involve qualitatively new ideas about \u201chow intelligence works\u201d.\nWhile the scaling laws still hold experimentally at the time of this writing (July 2022), whether they'll continue up to safety-relevant capabilities is still an open problem.\n",

This seems roughly analogous to setting an AGI loose on the real world.\n\nMotivation: Andrew Critch is primarily concerned about a multipolar AI scenario: there are multiple actors with comparably powerful AI, on the cusp of recursive self improvement. The worst case is a race, and even though each actor would want to take more time checking their AGI for safety, worry that another actor will deploy will push each actor to take shortcuts and try to pull off a world-saving act. Instead of working directly on AI, which can accelerate timelines and encourage racing, creating this standardized test environment where alignment failures are observable is one component of a good global outcome.\n"

The most popular architecture for very large language models is called a transformer, which follows consistent scaling laws with respect to the size of the model being trained, meaning that a larger model trained with the same amount of compute will produce results which are better by a predictable amount (when measured by the 'perplexity', or how surprised the AI is by a test set of human-generated text).",

He and his team are now <i>\u201ctrying to figure out how to train ML systems to answer questions by straightforwardly \u2018translating\u2019 their beliefs into natural language rather than by reasoning about what a human wants to hear.\u201d</i>\n\nChris Olah (after work at DeepMind and OpenAI) recently launched Anthropic, an AI lab focussed on the safety of large models. While his previous work was concerned with \u201ctransparency\u201d and \u201cinterpretability\u201d of large neural networks, especially vision models, Anthropic is focussing more on large language models, among other things working towards a <i>\"general-purpose, text-based assistant that is aligned with human values, meaning that it is helpful, honest, and harmless\".</i>\n\nStuart Russell and his team at the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) have been working on inverse reinforcement learning (where the AI infers human values from observing human behavior) and corrigibility, as well as attempts to disaggregate neural networks into \u201cmeaningful\u201d subcomponents (see Filan, et al.\u2019s \u201cClusterability in neural networks\u201d and Hod et al.'s \u201cDetecting modularity in deep neural networks\u201d).\n\nAlongside the more abstract \u201cagent foundations\u201d work they have become known for, MIRI recently announced their \u201cVisible Thoughts Project\u201d to test the hypothesis that <i>\u201cLanguage models can be made more understandable (and perhaps also more capable, though this is not the goal) by training them to produce visible thoughts.\u201d</i>\n\nOpenAI have recently been doing work on iteratively summarizing books (summarizing, and then summarizing the summary, etc.) as a method for scaling human oversight.\n\nStuart Armstrong\u2019s recently launched AlignedAI are mainly working on concept extrapolation from familiar to novel contexts, something he believes is \u201cnecessary and almost sufficient\u201d for AI alignment.\n\nRedwood Research (Buck Shlegeris, et al.) are trying to \u201chandicap' GPT-3 to only produce non-violent completions of text prompts. <i>\u201cThe idea is that there are many reasons we might ultimately want to apply some oversight function to an AI model, like \u2018don't be deceitful\u2019, and if we want to get AI teams to apply this we need to be able to incorporate these oversight predicates into the original model in an efficient manner.\u201d</i>\n\nOught is an independent AI safety research organization led by Andreas Stuhlm\u00fcller and Jungwon Byun.

These arguments are often of a substantial quality and are often presented by people who themselves worry about AI safety. Elverin calls these objections \u201cweak\u201d because they do not attempt to imply that the probability of a bad outcome is close to zero: <i>\u201cFor example, even if you accept Paul Christiano's arguments against \u201cfast takeoff\u201d, they only drive the probability of this down to about 20%. Weak counter-arguments are interesting, but the decision to personally focus on AI safety doesn't strongly depend on the probability \u2013 anything above 5% is clearly a big enough deal that it doesn't make sense to work on other things.\u201d</i>\n\nStrong arguments argue that the probability of existential catastrophe due to misaligned AI is tiny, usually by some combination of claiming that AGI is impossible or very far away. For example, Michael Littman has suggested that as (he believes) we\u2019re so far from AGI, there will be a long period of human history wherein we\u2019ll have ample time to grow up alongside powerful AIs and figure out how to align them.\n\nElverlin opines that <i>\u201cThere are few arguments that are both high-quality and strong enough to qualify as an \u2018objection to the importance of alignment\u2019.\u201d</i> He suggests Rohin Shah's arguments for \u201calignment by default\u201d as one of the better candidates.\n\nMIRI's April fools \"Death With Dignity\" strategy might be seen as an argument against the importance of working on alignment, but only in the sense that we might have almost no hope of solving it.

This way, the answer will also work for the questions \"Why can't we do X\" and \"What would happen if we tried to do X\".\n\nLinking to external sites is strongly encouraged, one of the most valuable things Stampy can do is help people find other parts of the alignment information ecosystem.\n\nConsider enclosing newly introduced terms, likely to be unfamiliar to many readers, in speech marks. If unsure, Google the term (in speech marks!) and see if it shows up anywhere other than LessWrong, the Alignment Forum, etc. Be judicious, as it's easy to use too many, but used carefully they can psychologically cushion newbies from a lot of unfamiliar terminology - in this context they're saying something like \"we get that we're hitting you with a lot of new vocab, and you might not know what this term means yet\".\n\nWhen selecting related questions, there shouldn't be more than four unless there's a really good reason for that (some questions are asking for it, like the \"Why can't we just...\" question). It's also recommended to include at least one more \"enticing\" question to draw users in (relating to the more sensational, sci-fi, philosophical/ethical side of things) alongside more bland/neutral questions.\n",

This seems to rely on being able to consistently exert optimization pressure against deception, which probably necessitates interpretability tools.\n\nHis plan to do this right now is acceptability verification: have some predicate that precludes deception, and then check your model for this predicate at every point in training.\n\nOne idea for this predicate is making sure that the agent is myopic, meaning that the AI only cares about the current timestep, so there is no incentive to deceive, because the benefits of deception happen only in the future. This is operationalized as \u201creturn the action that your model of HCH would return, if it received your inputs.\u201d\n",

So, if we optimize the observations to maximize the activation for an action, this will likely result in a sequence of observations which is impossible (incompatible with the transition function).\n\nA way around this is to compute an embedding of possible observation sequences and to optimize in the embedding space instead of the observation space.

Thus, applying RL to a model exerts pressure towards ideal logical reasoning. However, self-supervised learning (SSL) exerts some pressure back towards just doing text prediction, and hence more of its reasoning being in English.

    "content": "Question:\nWhat is &quot;greater-than-human intelligence&quot;?\n\nAnswer:\nMachines are already smarter than humans are at many specific tasks: performing calculations, playing chess, searching large databanks, detecting underwater mines, and more. But one thing that makes humans special is their general intelligence. Humans can intelligently adapt to radically new problems in the urban jungle or outer space for which evolution could not have prepared them. Humans can solve problems for which their brain hardware and software was never trained. Humans can even examine the processes that produce their own intelligence (cognitive neuroscience), and design new kinds of intelligence never seen before (artificial intelligence).\n\nTo possess greater-than-human intelligence, a machine must be able to achieve goals more effectively than humans can, in a wider range of environments than humans can. This kind of intelligence involves the capacity not just to do science and play chess, but also to manipulate the social environment.\n\nComputer scientist Marcus Hutter has described a formal model called AIXI that he says possesses the greatest general intelligence possible. But to implement it would require more computing power than all the matter in the universe can provide. Several projects try to approximate AIXI while still being computable, for example MC-AIXI.\n\nStill, there remains much work to be done before greater-than-human intelligence can be achieved in machines. Greater-than-human intelligence need not be achieved by directly programming a machine to be intelligent. It could also be achieved by whole brain emulation, by biological cognitive enhancement, or by brain-computer interfaces (see below).\n\nSee also:\n",

See the model splintering post for more detail. Stuart's plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\nThey are currently working on algorithms to accomplish step 1: see Value Extrapolation.\n\nTheir initial operationalization of this problem is the lion and husky problem. Basically: if you train an image model on a dataset of images of lions and huskies, the lions are always in the desert, and the huskies are always in the snow. So the problem of learning a classifier is under-defined: should the classifier be classifying based on the background environment (e.g. snow vs sand), or based on the animal in the image?\n\nA good extrapolation algorithm, on this problem, would generate classifiers that extrapolate in all the different ways[4], and so the 'correct' extrapolation must be in this generated set of classifiers. They have also introduced a new dataset for this, with a similar idea: Happy Faces.\n\nStep 2 could be done in different ways. Possibilities for doing this include: conservatism, generalized deference to humans, or an automated process for removing some goals. like wireheading/deception/killing everyone.\n"

The approach he pioneered is circuits: looking at computational subgraphs of the network, called circuits, and interpreting those. Idea: \"decompiling the network into a better representation that is more interpretable\". In-context learning via attention heads, and interpretability here seems useful.\n\nOne result I heard about recently: a linear softmax unit stretches space and encourages neuron monosemanticity (making a neuron represent only one thing, as opposed to firing on many unrelated concepts). This makes the network easier to interpret.\n\nMotivation: The point of this is to get as many bits of information about what neural networks are doing, to hopefully find better abstractions. This diagram gets posted everywhere, the hope being that networks, in the current regime, will become more interpretable because they will start to use abstractions that are closer to human abstractions.\n\n<b>How do you figure out model performance scales?</b>\n",

Conjecture has short timelines (the org acts like timelines are between ~5-10 year, but some have much shorter timelines, such as 2-4 years), and they think alignment is hard. They take information hazards (specifically ideas that could lead towards better AI capabilities) very seriously, and have a public infohazard document.\n\n<b>What is Conjecture's epistemology research agenda?</b>\n\nThe alignment problem is really hard to do science on: we are trying to reason about the future, and we only get one shot, meaning that we can't iterate. Therefore, it seems really useful to have a good understanding of meta-science/epistemology, i.e. reasoning about ways to do useful alignment research.\n\n<b>What is Conjecture's Scalable LLM Interpretability research adgenda?</b>\n\nI don't know much about their research here, other than that they train their own models, which allow them to work on models that are bigger than the biggest publicly available models, which seems like a difference from Redwood.\n\nCurrent interpretability methods are very low level (e.g., \"what does x neuron do\"), which does not help us answer high level questions like \"is this AI trying to kill us\".\n\nThey are trying a bunch of weird approaches, with the goal of scalable mechanistic interpretability, but I do not know what these approaches actually are.\n\nMotivation: Conjecture wants to build towards a better paradigm that will give us a lot more information, primarily from the empirical direction (as distinct from ARC, which is working on interpretability with a theoretical focus).\n\n<b>What is Refine?</b>\n\nRefine is an incubator for new decorrelated alignment \"research bets\". Since no approach is very promising right now for solving alignment, the purpose of this is to come up with a bunch of independent new ideas, and hopefully some of these will work.\n\n<b>What is the goal of Simulacra Theory?</b>\n\nThe goal of this is to create a non-agentic AI, in the form of an LLM, that is capable of accelerating alignment research. The hope is that there is some window between AI smart enough to help us with alignment and the really scary, self improving, consequentialist AI. Some things that this amplifier might do:\n\nA LLM can be thought of as learning the distribution over the next token given by the training data. Prompting the LM is then like conditioning this distribution on the start of the text. A key danger in alignment is applying unbounded optimization pressure towards a specific goal in the world. Conditioning a probability distribution does not behave like an agent applying optimization pressure towards a goal. Hence, this avoids goodhart-related problems, as well as some inner alignment failure.\n\nOne idea to get superhuman work from LLMs is to train it on amplified datasets like really high quality / difficult research. The key problem here is finding the dataset to allow for this.\n\nThere are some ways for this to fail:\n\nConjecture are aware of these problems and are running experiments. Specifically, an operationalization of the inner alignment problem is to make an LLM play chess. This (probably) requires simulating an optimizer trying to win at the game of chess. They are trying to use interpretability tools to find the mesa-optimizers in the chess LLM that is the agent trying to win the game of chess. We haven't ever found a real mesa-optimizer before, and so this could give loads of bits about the nature of inner alignment failure.\n"

    "content": "Question:\nWhat is John Wentworth&#39;s plan?\n\nAnswer:\nJohn's plan is:\n\nStep 1: sort out our fundamental confusions about agency\n\nStep 2: ambitious value learning (i.e. build an AI which correctly learns human values and optimizes for them)\n\nStep 3: \u2026\n\nStep 4: profit!\n\n\u2026 and do all that before AGI kills us all.\n\nHe is working on step 1: figuring out what the heck is going on with agency. His current approach is based on selection theorems: try to figure out what types of agents are selected for in a broad range of environments. Examples of selection pressures include: evolution, SGD, and markets. This is an approach to agent foundations that comes from the opposite direction as MIRI: it's more about observing existing structures (whether they be mathematical or real things in the world like markets or e coli), whereas MIRI is trying to write out some desiderata and then finding mathematical notions that satisfy those desiderata.\n\nTwo key properties that might be selected for are modularity and abstractions.\n\nAbstractions are higher level things that people tend to use to describe things. Like \"Tree\" and \"Chair\" and \"Person\". These are all vague categories that contain lots of different things, but are really useful for narrowing down things. Humans tend to use really similar abstractions, even across different cultures / societies. The Natural Abstraction Hypothesis (NAH) states that a wide variety of cognitive architectures will tend to use similar abstractions to reason about the world. This might be helpful for alignment because we could say things like \"person\" without having to rigorously and precisely say exactly what we mean by person.\n\nThe NAH seems very plausibly true for physical objects in the world, and so it might be true for the inputs to human values. If so, it would be really helpful for AI alignment because understanding this would amount to a solution to the ontology identification problem: we can understand when environments induce certain abstractions, and so we can design this so that the network has the same abstractions as humans.\n\nModularity: In pretty much any selection environment, we see lots of obvious modularity. Biological species have cells and organs and limbs. Companies have departments. We might expect neural networks to be similar, but it is really hard to find modules in neural networks. We need to find the right lens to look through to find this modularity in neural networks. Aiming at this can lead us to really good interpretability.\n"

    "content": "Question:\nWhat is an &quot;intelligence explosion&quot;?\n\nAnswer:\nThe intelligence explosion idea was expressed by statistician I.J. Good in 1965:\n\nLet an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an \u2018intelligence explosion\u2019, and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.\nThe argument is this: Every year, computers surpass human abilities in new ways. A program written in 1956 was able to prove mathematical theorems, and found a more elegant proof for one of them than Russell and Whitehead had given in <i>Principia Mathematica</i>. By the late 1990s, \u2018expert systems\u2019 had surpassed human skill for a wide range of tasks. In 1997, IBM\u2019s Deep Blue computer beat the world chess champion, and in 2011, IBM\u2019s Watson computer beat the best human players at a much more complicated game: Jeopardy!. Recently, a robot named Adam was programmed with our scientific knowledge about yeast, then posed its own hypotheses, tested them, and assessed the results.\n\nComputers remain far short of human intelligence, but the resources that aid AI design are accumulating (including hardware, large datasets, neuroscience knowledge, and AI theory). We may one day design a machine that surpasses human skill at designing artificial intelligences. After that, this machine could improve its own intelligence faster and better than humans can, which would make it even more skilled at improving its own intelligence. This could continue in a positive feedback loop such that the machine quickly becomes vastly more intelligent than the smartest human being on Earth: an \u2018intelligence explosion\u2019 resulting in a machine superintelligence.\n\nThis is what is meant by the \u2018intelligence explosion\u2019 in this FAQ.\n\nSee also:\n",

This may be an extremely hard problem, especially with deep learning, and is likely to determine the outcome of the most important century. Alignment research is strongly interdisciplinary and can include computer science, mathematics, neuroscience, philosophy, and social sciences.\n\n<i>AGI safety</i> is a related concept which strongly overlaps with AI alignment. AGI safety is concerned with making sure that building AGI systems doesn\u2019t cause things to go badly wrong, and the main way in which things can go badly wrong is through misalignment. AGI safety includes policy work that prevents the building of dangerous AGI systems, or reduces misuse risks from AGI systems aligned to actors who don\u2019t have humanity\u2019s best interests in mind.\n",

For more information see their 2022 progress report.\n\nStuart wrote the book Human Compatible, in which he outlines his AGI alignment strategy, which is based on cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL). The basic idea of CIRL is to play a cooperative game where both the agent and the human are trying to maximize the human's reward, but only the human knows what the human reward is. Since the AGI has uncertainty it will defer to humans and be corrigible.\n\nOther work includes Clusterability in neural networks: try to measure the modularity of neural networks by thinking of the network as a graph and performing the graph n-cut.\n",

Many AI systems are programmed to have goals and to attain them as effectively as possible \u2013 for example, a trading algorithm has the goal of maximizing profit.

A degree in <b>mathematics</b>, <b>computer science</b>, or directly in <b>AI</b>, is a good way to build this understanding. However, AI alignment also benefits from having researchers with diverse backgrounds, so if you have a particular interest or talent in a different topic, it can be valuable to pursue a degree in that topic instead. For example, degrees that could be relevant are neuroscience, philosophy, physics, biology, cybersecurity, risk management, safety engineering, or economics. It has been argued in particular that AI safety needs social scientists.\n\nIf you are uncertain, you can apply for coaching from the the career advice platform 80000 hours, which also has a career review of technical AI safety research. Another option is to apply for coaching from AI safety support.\n\nWhen choosing university courses, try to cover\n\nIn addition to taking relevant university courses, it is also really helpful to study AI safety materials outside of university.

    "content": "Question:\nWhat technical problems are MIRI working on?\n\nAnswer:\n\u201cAligning smarter-than-human AI with human interests\u201d is an extremely vague goal. To approach this problem productively, we attempt to factorize it into several subproblems. As a starting point, we ask: \u201cWhat aspects of this problem would we still be unable to solve even if the problem were much easier?\u201d\n\nIn order to achieve real-world goals more effectively than a human, a general AI system will need to be able to learn its environment over time and decide between possible proposals or actions. A simplified version of the alignment problem, then, would be to ask how we could construct a system that learns its environment and has a very crude decision criterion, like \u201cSelect the policy that maximizes the expected number of diamonds in the world.\u201d\n\n<i>Highly reliable agent design</i> is the technical challenge of formally specifying a software system that can be relied upon to pursue some preselected toy goal. An example of a subproblem in this space is ontology identification: how do we formalize the goal of \u201cmaximizing diamonds\u201d in full generality, allowing that a fully autonomous agent may end up in unexpected environments and may construct unanticipated hypotheses and policies? Even if we had unbounded computational power and all the time in the world, we don\u2019t currently know how to solve this problem. This suggests that we\u2019re not only missing practical algorithms but also a basic theoretical framework through which to understand the problem.\n\nThe formal agent AIXI is an attempt to define what we mean by \u201coptimal behavior\u201d in the case of a reinforcement learner. A simple AIXI-like equation is lacking, however, for defining what we mean by \u201cgood behavior\u201d if the goal is to change something about the external world (and not just to maximize a pre-specified reward number). In order for the agent to evaluate its world-models to count the number of diamonds, as opposed to having a privileged reward channel, what general formal properties must its world-models possess? If the system updates its hypotheses (e.g., discovers that string theory is true and quantum physics is false) in a way its programmers didn\u2019t expect, how does it identify \u201cdiamonds\u201d in the new model? The question is a very basic one, yet the relevant theory is currently missing.\n\nWe can distinguish highly reliable agent design from the problem of value specification: \u201cOnce we understand how to design an autonomous AI system that promotes a goal, how do we ensure its goal actually matches what we want?\u201d Since human error is inevitable and we will need to be able to safely supervise and redesign AI algorithms even as they approach human equivalence in cognitive tasks, MIRI also works on formalizing error-tolerant agent properties. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, the standard textbook in AI, summarizes the challenge:\n\nYudkowsky [\u2026] asserts that friendliness (a desire not to harm humans) should be designed in from the start, but that the designers should recognize both that their own designs may be flawed, and that the robot will learn and evolve over time. Thus the challenge is one of mechanism design \u2014 to design a mechanism for evolving AI under a system of checks and balances, and to give the systems utility functions that will remain friendly in the face of such changes.\n-Russell and Norvig (2009). Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.\nOur technical agenda describes these open problems in more detail, and our research guide collects online resources for learning more.\n",

    "content": "Question:\nWhat would a good solution to AI alignment look like?\n\nAnswer:\nAn actually good solution to AI alignment might look like a superintelligence that understands, agrees with, and deeply believes in human morality.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have to command a superintelligence like this to cure cancer; it would already want to cure cancer, for the same reasons you do. But it would also be able to compare the costs and benefits of curing cancer with those of other uses of its time, like solving global warming or discovering new physics. It wouldn\u2019t have any urge to cure cancer by nuking the world, for the same reason you don\u2019t have any urge to cure cancer by nuking the world \u2013 because your goal isn\u2019t to \u201ccure cancer\u201d, per se, it\u2019s to improve the lives of people everywhere. Curing cancer the normal way accomplishes that; nuking the world doesn\u2019t.\nThis sort of solution would mean we\u2019re no longer fighting against the AI \u2013 trying to come up with rules so smart that it couldn\u2019t find loopholes. We would be on the same side, both wanting the same thing.\n\nIt would also mean that the CEO of Google (or the head of the US military, or Vladimir Putin) couldn\u2019t use the AI to take over the world for themselves. The AI would have its own values and be able to agree or disagree with anybody, including its creators.\n\nIt might not make sense to talk about \u201ccommanding\u201d such an AI. After all, any command would have to go through its moral system. Certainly it would reject a command to nuke the world. But it might also reject a command to cure cancer, if it thought that solving global warming was a higher priority. For that matter, why would one want to command this AI? It values the same things you value, but it\u2019s much smarter than you and much better at figuring out how to achieve them. Just turn it on and let it do its thing.\n\nWe could still treat this AI as having an open-ended maximizing goal. The goal would be something like \u201cTry to make the world a better place according to the values and wishes of the people in it.\u201d\n\nThe only problem with this is that human morality is very complicated, so much so that philosophers have been arguing about it for thousands of years without much progress, let alone anything specific enough to enter into a computer. Different cultures and individuals have different moral codes, such that a superintelligence following the morality of the King of Saudi Arabia might not be acceptable to the average American, and vice versa.\n\nOne solution might be to give the AI an understanding of what we mean by morality \u2013 \u201cthat thing that makes intuitive sense to humans but is hard to explain\u201d, and then ask it to use its superintelligence to fill in the details. Needless to say, this suffers from various problems \u2013 it has potential loopholes, it\u2019s hard to code, and a single bug might be disastrous \u2013 but if it worked, it would be one of the few genuinely satisfying ways to design a goal architecture.\n",

This removes the moderating influence of human personnel as convincing machines to do a horrible thing is easier than convincing humans. Despots need security forces to remain in power. Human security forces betraying a despot is a common way that despots lose power, this would not happen with robots.\n\nAnother consideration is that computer security is hard! Autonomous weapons could be hacked, initially by humans but eventually by an AGI. This is not good for humanity's chances of surviving the transition to AGI, although access to autonomous weapons is probably not necessary for this transition to go poorly.\n\nSee also Stop Killer Robots.\n",

There\u2019s nothing intrinsically flawed with this procedure. However, this suggestion is deceptive because it sounds simpler than it is.\n\nIf you get a chimpanzee baby and raise it in a human family, it does not learn to speak a human language. Human babies can grow into adult humans because the babies have specific properties, e.g. a prebuilt language module that gets activated during childhood.\n\nIn order to make a child AI that has the potential to turn into the type of adult AI we would find acceptable, the child AI has to have specific properties. The task of building a child AI with these properties involves building a system that can interpret what humans mean when we try to teach the child to do various tasks.

However, once an AGI establishes itself, we could not unless it was corrigible and willing to let humans adjust it. There may be a period in the early stages of an AGI's development where it would be trying very hard to convince us that we should not shut it down and/or hiding itself and/or recursively self-improving and/or making copies of itself onto every server on earth.\n\nInstrumental Convergence and the Stop Button Problem are the key reasons it would not be simple to shut down a non corrigible advanced system. If the AI wants to collect stamps, being turned off means it gets less stamps, so even without an explicit goal of not being turned off it has an instrumental reason to avoid being turned off (e.g. once it acquires a detailed world model and general intelligence, it is likely to realise that by playing nice and pretending to be aligned if you have the power to turn it off, establishing control over any system we put in place to shut it down, and eliminating us if it has the power to reliably do so and we would otherwise pose a threat).\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZeecOKBus3Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3TYT1QfdfsM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n",

There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this procedure - keeping an AI system in a secure software environment would make it safer than letting it roam free. However, even AI systems inside software environments might not be safe enough.\n\nHumans sometimes put dangerous humans inside boxes to limit their ability to influence the external world. Sometimes, these humans escape their boxes. The security of a prison depends on certain assumptions, which can be violated. Yoshie Shiratori reportedly escaped prison by weakening the door-frame with miso soup and dislocating his shoulders.\n\nHuman written software has a high defect rate; we should expect a perfectly secure system to be difficult to create. If humans construct a software system they think is secure, it is possible that the security relies on a false assumption. A powerful AI system could potentially learn how its hardware works and manipulate bits to send radio signals. It could fake a malfunction and attempt social engineering when the engineers look at its code. As the saying goes: in order for someone to do something we had imagined was impossible requires only that they have a better imagination.\n\nExperimentally, humans have convinced other humans to let them out of the box.

Having more agency is a convergent instrument goal and a stable attractor which the random walk of updates and experiences will eventually stumble into.\n\nThe stability is because utility maximizer-like systems which have control over their development would lose utility if they allowed themselves to develop into non-utility maximizers, so they tend to use their available optimization power to avoid that change (a special case of goal stability). The capability is because non-utility maximizers are exploitable, and because agency is a general trick which applies to many domains, so might well arise naturally when training on some tasks.\n\nHumans and systems made of humans (e.g. organizations, governments) generally have neither the introspective ability nor self-modification tools needed to become reflectively stable, but we can reasonably predict that in the long run highly capable systems will have these properties. They can then fix in and optimize for their values.\n",

But a moderate or hard takeoff means there wouldn\u2019t be enough time to deal with the problem as it occurs, suggesting a role for preemptive planning.\n\nAs an aside, let\u2019s take the \u201coverpopulation on Mars\u201d comparison seriously. Suppose Mars has a carrying capacity of 10 billion people, and we decide it makes sense to worry about overpopulation on Mars only once it is 75% of the way to its limit. Start with 100 colonists who double every twenty years. By the second generation there are 200 colonists; by the third, 400. Mars reaches 75% of its carrying capacity after 458 years, and crashes into its population limit after 464 years. So there were 464 years in which the Martians could have solved the problem, but they insisted on waiting until there were only six years left. Good luck solving a planetwide population crisis in six years. The moral of the story is that exponential trends move faster than you think and you need to start worrying about them early.\n",

But \"general intelligence\" is more of a description of a system's capabilities, and a vague one at that. We don't know what it takes to build such a system. This leads to the worrying possibility that our existing, narrow AI systems require only minor tweaks, or even just more computer power, to achieve general intelligence.\n\nThe pace of research in the field suggests that there's a lot of low-hanging fruit left to pick, after all, and the results of this research produce better, more effective AI in a landscape of strong competitive pressure to produce as highly competitive systems as we can. \"Just\" not building an AGI means ensuring that every organization in the world with lots of computer hardware doesn't build an AGI, either accidentally or mistakenly thinking they have a solution to the alignment problem, forever.

    "content": "Question:\nWhy is safety important for smarter-than-human AI?\n\nAnswer:\nPresent-day AI algorithms already demand special safety guarantees when they must act in important domains without human oversight, particularly when they or their environment can change over time:\n\nAchieving these gains [from autonomous systems] will depend on development of entirely new methods for enabling \u201ctrust in autonomy\u201d through verification and validation (V&amp;V) of the near-infinite state systems that result from high levels of [adaptability] and autonomy. In effect, the number of possible input states that such systems can be presented with is so large that not only is it impossible to test all of them directly, it is not even feasible to test more than an insignificantly small fraction of them. Development of such systems is thus inherently unverifiable by today\u2019s methods, and as a result their operation in all but comparatively trivial applications is uncertifiable.\n\nIt is possible to develop systems having high levels of autonomy, but it is the lack of suitable V&amp;V methods that prevents all but relatively low levels of autonomy from being certified for use.\n\n\n- Office of the US Air Force Chief Scientist (2010). Technology Horizons: A Vision for Air Force Science and Technology 2010-30.\nAs AI capabilities improve, it will become easier to give AI systems greater autonomy, flexibility, and control; and there will be increasingly large incentives to make use of these new possibilities. The potential for AI systems to become more general, in particular, will make it difficult to establish safety guarantees: reliable regularities during testing may not always hold post-testing.\n\nThe largest and most lasting changes in human welfare have come from scientific and technological innovation \u2014 which in turn comes from our intelligence. In the long run, then, much of AI\u2019s significance comes from its potential to automate and enhance progress in science and technology. The creation of smarter-than-human AI brings with it the basic risks and benefits of intellectual progress itself, at digital speeds.\n\nAs AI agents become more capable, it becomes more important (and more difficult) to analyze and verify their decisions and goals. Stuart Russell writes:\n\nThe primary concern is not spooky emergent consciousness but simply the ability to make high-quality decisions. Here, quality refers to the expected outcome utility of actions taken, where the utility function is, presumably, specified by the human designer. Now we have a problem:\n\n\nA system that is optimizing a function of n variables, where the objective depends on a subset of size k&lt;n, will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable. This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer\u2019s apprentice, or King Midas: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want.\nBostrom\u2019s \u201cThe Superintelligent Will\u201d lays out these two concerns in more detail: that we may not correctly specify our actual goals in programming smarter-than-human AI systems, and that most agents optimizing for a misspecified goal will have incentives to treat humans adversarially, as potential threats or obstacles to achieving the agent\u2019s goal.\n\nIf the goals of human and AI agents are not well-aligned, the more knowledgeable and technologically capable agent may use force to get what it wants, as has occurred in many conflicts between human communities. Having noticed this class of concerns in advance, we have an opportunity to reduce risk from this default scenario by directing research toward aligning artificial decision-makers\u2019 interests with our own.\n",

According to many computer scientists, giving a superintelligence an open-ended goal without activating human instincts and counterbalancing considerations will usually lead to disaster.\n\nTo take a deliberately extreme example: suppose someone programs a superintelligence to calculate as many digits of pi as it can within one year. And suppose that, with its current computing power, it can calculate one trillion digits during that time. It can either accept one trillion digits, or spend a month trying to figure out how to get control of the TaihuLight supercomputer, which can calculate two hundred times faster. Even if it loses a little bit of time in the effort, and even if there\u2019s a small chance of failure, the payoff \u2013 two hundred trillion digits of pi, compared to a mere one trillion \u2013 is enough to make the attempt. But on the same basis, it would be even better if the superintelligence could control every computer in the world and set it to the task. And it would be better still if the superintelligence controlled human civilization, so that it could direct humans to build more computers and speed up the process further.\n\nNow we\u2019re in a situation where a superintelligence wants to take over the world. Taking over the world allows it to calculate more digits of pi than any other option, so without an architecture based around understanding human instincts and counterbalancing considerations, even a goal like \u201ccalculate as many digits of pi as you can\u201d would be potentially dangerous.\n",

That could be bad if an enemy government controls it and asks it to help invent superweapons \u2013 but then the problem is the enemy government, not the AI <i>per se</i>. Is there any reason to be afraid of the AI itself? Suppose the AI did appear to be hostile, suppose it even wanted to take over the world: why should we think it has any chance of doing so?\n\nThere are numerous carefully thought-out AGI-related scenarios which could result in the accidental extinction of humanity. But rather than focussing on any of these individually, it might be more helpful to think in general terms.\n\n\"Transistors can fire about 10 million times faster than human brain cells, so it's possible we'll eventually have digital minds operating 10 million times faster than us, meaning from a decision-making perspective we'd look to them like stationary objects, like plants or rocks... To give you a sense, here's what humans look like when slowed down by only around 100x.\"<i><br /></i>\n\n<br />Watch that, and now try to imagine advanced AI technology running for a single year around the world, making decisions and taking actions 10 million times faster than we can. That year for us becomes 10 million subjective years for the AI, in which \"...there are these nearly-stationary plant-like or rock-like \"human\" objects around that could easily be taken apart for, say, biofuel or carbon atoms, if you could just get started building a human-disassembler. Visualizing things this way, you can start to see all the ways that a digital civilization can develop very quickly into a situation where there are no humans left alive, just as human civilization doesn't show much regard for plants or wildlife or insects.\"\n\nAndrew Critch - Slow Motion Videos as AI Risk Intuition Pumps\nAnd even putting aside these issues of speed and subjective time, the difference in (intelligence-based) power-to-manipulate-the-world between a self-improving superintelligent AGI and humanity could be far more extreme than the difference in such power between humanity and insects.\n\n\u201cAI Could Defeat All Of Us Combined\u201d is a more in-depth argument by the CEO of Open Philanthropy.\n",

    "content": "Question:\nWhy might people try to build AGI rather than stronger and stronger narrow AIs?\n\nAnswer:\nMaking a narrow AI for every task would be extremely costly and time-consuming. By making a more general intelligence, you can apply one system to a broader range of tasks, which is economically and strategically attractive.\n\nOf course, for generality to be a good option there are some necessary conditions. You need an architecture which is straightforward enough to scale up, such as the transformer which is used for GPT and follows scaling laws. It's also important that by generalizing you do not lose too much capacity at narrow tasks or require too much extra compute for it to be worthwhile.\n\nWhether or not those conditions actually hold: It seems like many important actors (such as DeepMind and OpenAI) believe that they do, and are therefore focusing on trying to build an AGI in order to influence the future, so we should take actions to make it more likely that AGI will be developed safety.\n\nAdditionally, it is possible that even if we tried to build only narrow AIs, given enough time and compute we might accidentally create a more general AI than we intend by training a system on a task which requires a broad world model.\n\nSee also:\n",

    "content": "Question:\nWhy might we expect a superintelligence to be hostile by default?\n\nAnswer:\nThe argument goes: computers only do what we command them; no more, no less. So it might be bad if terrorists or enemy countries develop superintelligence first. But if we develop superintelligence first there\u2019s no problem. Just command it to do the things we want, right?\nSuppose we wanted a superintelligence to cure cancer. How might we specify the goal \u201ccure cancer\u201d? We couldn\u2019t guide it through every individual step; if we knew every individual step, then we could cure cancer ourselves. Instead, we would have to give it a final goal of curing cancer, and trust the superintelligence to come up with intermediate actions that furthered that goal. For example, a superintelligence might decide that the first step to curing cancer was learning more about protein folding, and set up some experiments to investigate protein folding patterns.\n\nA superintelligence would also need some level of common sense to decide which of various strategies to pursue. Suppose that investigating protein folding was very likely to cure 50% of cancers, but investigating genetic engineering was moderately likely to cure 90% of cancers. Which should the AI pursue? Presumably it would need some way to balance considerations like curing as much cancer as possible, as quickly as possible, with as high a probability of success as possible.\n\nBut a goal specified in this way would be very dangerous. Humans instinctively balance thousands of different considerations in everything they do; so far this hypothetical AI is only balancing three (least cancer, quickest results, highest probability). To a human, it would seem maniacally, even psychopathically, obsessed with cancer curing. If this were truly its goal structure, it would go wrong in almost comical ways. This type of problem, specification gaming, has been observed in many AI systems.\n\nIf your only goal is \u201ccuring cancer\u201d, and you lack humans\u2019 instinct for the thousands of other important considerations, a relatively easy solution might be to hack into a nuclear base, launch all of its missiles, and kill everyone in the world. This satisfies all the AI\u2019s goals. It reduces cancer down to zero (which is better than medicines which work only some of the time). It\u2019s very fast (which is better than medicines which might take a long time to invent and distribute). And it has a high probability of success (medicines might or might not work; nukes definitely do).\n\nSo simple goal architectures are likely to go very wrong unless tempered by common sense and a broader understanding of what we do and do not value.\n\nEven if we do train the AI on an actually desirable goal, there is also the risk of the AI actually learning a different and undesirable objective. This problem is called inner alignment.\n",

The fate of thousands of species depends on our actions, we occupy nearly every corner of the globe, and we repurpose vast amounts of the world's resources for our own use. Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) has potential to be vastly more intelligent than us, and therefore vastly more powerful. In the same way that we have reshaped the earth to fit our goals, an ASI will find unforeseen, highly efficient ways of reshaping reality to fit its goals.\n\nThe impact that an ASI will have on our world depends on what those goals are. We have the advantage of designing those goals, but that task is not as simple as it may first seem. As described by MIRI in their Intelligence Explosion FAQ:\n\n\u201cA superintelligent machine will make decisions based on the mechanisms it is designed with, not the hopes its designers had in mind when they programmed those mechanisms. It will act only on precise specifications of rules and values, and will do so in ways that need not respect the complexity and subtlety of what humans value.\u201d\n\nIf we do not solve the Control Problem before the first ASI is created, we may not get another chance.\n",

    "content": "Question:\nWhy think that AI can outperform humans?\n\nAnswer:\nMachines are already smarter than humans are at many specific tasks: performing calculations, playing chess, searching large databanks, detecting underwater mines, and more. However, human intelligence continues to dominate machine intelligence in generality.\n\nA powerful chess computer is \u201cnarrow\u201d: it can\u2019t play other games. In contrast, humans have problem-solving abilities that allow us to adapt to new contexts and excel in many domains other than what the ancestral environment prepared us for.\n\nIn the absence of a formal definition of \u201cintelligence\u201d (and therefore of \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d), we can heuristically cite humans\u2019 perceptual, inferential, and deliberative faculties (as opposed to, e.g., our physical strength or agility) and say that intelligence is \u201cthose kinds of things.\u201d On this conception, intelligence is a bundle of distinct faculties \u2014 albeit a very important bundle that includes our capacity for science.\n\nOur cognitive abilities stem from high-level patterns in our brains, and these patterns can be instantiated in silicon as well as carbon. This tells us that general AI is possible, though it doesn\u2019t tell us how difficult it is. If intelligence is sufficiently difficult to understand, then we may arrive at machine intelligence by scanning and emulating human brains or by some trial-and-error process (like evolution), rather than by hand-coding a software agent.\n\nIf machines can achieve human equivalence in cognitive tasks, then it is very likely that they can eventually outperform humans. There is little reason to expect that biological evolution, with its lack of foresight and planning, would have hit upon the optimal algorithms for general intelligence (any more than it hit upon the optimal flying machine in birds). Beyond qualitative improvements in cognition, Nick Bostrom notes more straightforward advantages we could realize in digital minds, e.g.:\n\nAny one of these advantages could give an AI reasoner an edge over a human reasoner, or give a group of AI reasoners an edge over a human group. Their combination suggests that digital minds could surpass human minds more quickly and decisively than we might expect.\n",

One might say that \u201cIntelligence is no match for a gun, or for someone with lots of money,\u201d but both guns and money were produced by intelligence. If not for our intelligence, humans would still be foraging the savannah for food.\n\nIntelligence is what caused humans to dominate the planet in the blink of an eye (on evolutionary timescales). Intelligence is what allows us to eradicate diseases, and what gives us the potential to eradicate ourselves with nuclear war. Intelligence gives us superior strategic skills, superior social skills, superior economic productivity, and the power of invention.\n\nA machine with superintelligence would be able to hack into vulnerable networks via the internet, commandeer those resources for additional computing power, take over mobile machines connected to networks connected to the internet, use them to build additional machines, perform scientific experiments to understand the world better than humans can, invent quantum computing and nanotechnology, manipulate the social world better than we can, and do whatever it can to give itself more power to achieve its goals \u2014 all at a speed much faster than humans can respond to.\n\nSee also\n",

    "content": "Question:\nWon\u2019t AI be just like us?\n\nAnswer:\nThe degree to which an Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) would resemble us depends heavily on how it is implemented, but it seems that differences are unavoidable. If AI is accomplished through whole brain emulation and we make a big effort to make it as human as possible (including giving it a humanoid body), the AI could probably be said to think like a human. However, by definition of ASI it would be much smarter. Differences in the substrate and body might open up numerous possibilities (such as immortality, different sensors, easy self-improvement, ability to make copies, etc.). Its social experience and upbringing would likely also be entirely different. All of this can significantly change the ASI's values and outlook on the world, even if it would still use the same algorithms as we do. This is essentially the \"best case scenario\" for human resemblance, but whole brain emulation is kind of a separate field from AI, even if both aim to build intelligent machines. Most approaches to AI are vastly different and most ASIs would likely not have humanoid bodies. At this moment in time it seems much easier to create a machine that is intelligent than a machine that is exactly like a human (it's certainly a bigger target).\n",

This means that the person directing the money will be allocating enough that it's worth their time to do more in-depth research.\n\nFor an overview of the work the major organizations are doing, see the 2021 AI Alignment Literature Review and Charity Comparison.

    "content": "Question:\nWould it improve the safety of quantilizers to cut off the top few percent of the distribution?\n\nAnswer:\nThis is a really interesting question! Because, yeah it certainly seems to me that doing something like this would at least help, but it's not mentioned in the paper the video is based on. So I asked the author of the paper, and she said \"It wouldn't improve the security guarantee in the paper, so it wasn't discussed. Like, there's a plausible case that it's helpful, but nothing like a proof that it is\".\nTo explain this I need to talk about something I gloss over in the video, which is that the quantilizer isn't really something you can actually build. The systems we study in AI Safety tend to fall somewhere on a spectrum from \"real, practical AI system that is so messy and complex that it's hard to really think about or draw any solid conclusions from\" on one end, to \"mathematical formalism that we can prove beautiful theorems about but not actually build\" on the other, and quantilizers are pretty far towards the 'mathematical' end. It's not practical to run an expected utility calculation on every possible action like that, for one thing. But, proving things about quantilizers gives us insight into how more practical AI systems may behave, or we may be able to build approximations of quantilizers, etc.\nSo it's like, if we built something that was quantilizer-like, using a sensible human utility function and a good choice of safe distribution, this idea would probably help make it safer. BUT you can't prove that mathematically, without making probably a lot of extra assumptions about the utility function and/or the action distribution. So it's a potentially good idea that's nonetheless hard to express within the framework in which the quantilizer exists.\nTL;DR: This is likely a good idea! But can we prove it?\n",

Imagine she succeeds, only to be hit by a car herself. Imagine she lives only long enough to die in pain.\n\nThough you may imagine this thing, you cannot feel the full tragedy. You can\u2019t comprehend the rich inner life of that child. You can\u2019t understand her potential; your mind is not itself large enough to contain the sadness of an entire life cut short.\n\nYou can only catch a glimpse of what is lost\u2014<br />\n\u2014when one single human being dies.\n\nNow tell me again how it would be \"all right\" if every single person were to die at once.\n\nMany people, when they picture the end of humankind, pattern match the idea to some romantic tragedy, where humans, with all their hate and all their avarice, had been unworthy of the stars since the very beginning, and deserved their fate. A sad but poignant ending to our tale.\n\nAnd indeed, there are many parts of human nature that I hope we leave behind before we venture to the heavens. But in our nature is also everything worth bringing with us. Beauty and curiosity and love, a capacity for fun and growth and joy: these are our birthright, ours to bring into the barren night above.\n\nCalamities seem more salient when unpacked. It is far harder to kill a hundred people in their sleep, with a knife, than it is to order a nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Your brain can\u2019t multiply, you see: it can only look at a hypothetical image of a broken city and decide it\u2019s not that bad. It can only conjure an image of a barren planet and say \"eh, we had it coming.\"\n\nBut if you unpack the scenario, if you try to comprehend all the lives snuffed out, all the children killed, the final spark of human joy and curiosity extinguished, all our potential squandered\u2026\n\n\nI promise you that the extermination of humankind would be horrific."
