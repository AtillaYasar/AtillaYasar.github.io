    - zaltys-replies.html has his replies to other people, including the other person's post he replied to  
    - zaltys-all.html has all his posts  
    - layout:  
        - "Other" and "Zaltys" are purple  
        - first occurrence of search term in found posts is light green (main text is green)  
        - text within ``` is in blockquotes and, pre, and has a lighter background color (#111 as opposed to #000), to resemble Discord's effect
