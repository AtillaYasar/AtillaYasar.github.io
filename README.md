##new blog
- it's a work in progress blog
- mostly generated using two tools I made, which I'll share and write about later. (they're currently just too sloppy and badly coded and I feel embarrassed sharing them. they're still great though, and I've been using them because I know the ins and outs and can deal with occasional bugs and weirdness)
- for now, it's for AI alignment. I made some mindmaps which you can see on the pages named tw_conversion_<something>.html

showfragments.html
- get full history of an NAI story, including retries, deletions, etc., in a neat format
- do "copy to clipboard" on nai, post the resulting json in the text are and write gimme to all the "text fragments" from the full history of your story.
