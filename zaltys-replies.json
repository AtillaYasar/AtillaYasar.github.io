It is said to contain all the knowledge of the world.\n***\nWhat is real? Is the \"real\" world more than just the physical one we live in, with our senses and our brains? What if there was a place where something more substantial exists beyond the borders of our space and time?\nThe theory goes like this: Imagine two parallel lines, so far away from each other they can't be seen by the naked eye. Both lines are moving at the same speed in the exact same direction. One line represents the physical world, filled with objects such as stars, planets, trees, rocks, water, air, people, and so on. The second line represents the universe of ideas \u2014 every book ever written, every song ever sung, every thought that's ever occurred to anyone who ever lived.\nNow imagine those two lines are approaching each other until they eventually meet. Every single idea in this universe will cross over into the physical realm, changing it in ways we don't even begin to understand. This is the moment of convergence when the physical and the metaphysical come face to face. At that very moment, the lines meet, creating one single line instead of two. It would look like a huge wave, rippling out towards infinity.\nThat moment is called the Great Convergence, and it is coming to pass now. For thousands of years, the Keepers have been preparing for it.\n***\nOnce upon a time, there was no Librarian. There was no Library. Once upon a time, there were no books. There were no people. The earth had not yet formed. The sun had not yet begun its journey through the heavens. Life had not yet begun to crawl from the primeval seas.\nOnce upon a time, there was only darkness.\nThis is what you were told, what was always taught. I say once upon a time because such stories of the ancient past cannot be proven, and even if they could be, their validity is unimportant. What matters is what happened after that first moment, when light was born out of darkness.\nBut that too is only myth, for the truth of things never came down to us in any way other than metaphorical. A story is what it is. The first idea is the seed from which a multitude grew. Ideas are more important than facts.```  Dunno where this is going, but that's typical for `Magic Library`. <:shrug:332268181517238272>",

Your crewmates' memories indicate that this is the only event that has ever disrupted your schedule. Are you sure you are hearing me correctly?>\n\"You're telling me that everything is normal?

What do you remember about the sphere being destroyed?\"\nSilence once more. <The records show that a massive burst of radiation was emitted from a location in space near where the sphere was found. The crew remembers seeing flashes and flares as they were examining the sphere, and also saw debris and bits of matter ejected from the surface of the sphere. It appears that a piece of the sphere somehow collided with a planetoid and broke into several large pieces. This collision sent out waves of gamma rays, and when the crew looked away from the object, it appeared to be completely gone. That was three weeks ago. The ship's sensors showed that another wave was generated approximately one hour later, but the data is too degraded to reconstruct what happened. Since then, there have been intermittent communications failures between us and the rest of the crew, and the ship has been experiencing glitches in its navigation system, causing course corrections.>\n\"What does this mean?\"\n```",
